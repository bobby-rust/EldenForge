Spellblade is a quality build that utilizes Claymore and Glintblade Phalanx Ashes of War. Primarily scales with strength and intelligence and heavily relies on periodic stance-breaking and critical hits. Rendering enemies unable to retaliate.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Claymore x1, Academy Glintstone Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Carian Knight Helm, Blue Silver Mail Armor, Black Knife Gauntlets, Black Knife Greaves, or any armor with high protection and 51+ Poise
Talismans: Axe Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Assasin's Cerulean Dagger, Spear Talisman, & more suggested talismans in the video.
Primary Stats: Vigor, Strength & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Glintblade Phalanx
Spells: Scholar's Armament
Spellblade build is an aggressive build that relies on a Claymore to deal major damage to its enemy. Follow up with Academy Glintstone Staff that further boosts overall damage by buffing Claymore with Scholar Armament. Glintblade Phalanx on the other hand is a great addition to the Spellblade's repertoire as it further enhances the stance-breaking capabilities of the build.

The way how this build behaves is you will constantly use the R2 charge attacks of your Claymore buffed with Scholar Armament. With Claymore's incredibly long reach and powerful thrust attack, fights with regular enemies or even boss fights can be trivialized due to the Spellblade's immense stance damage. On top of that, Glintblade Phalanx adds more value to this build by providing bonus range damage and a unique follow-up thrust attack that can be done in a quick manner. However, the main takeaway is the additional stance damage that it can provide thus it will work wonders with Claymore. Expect stun locks and frequent critical strikes, especially for bosses that lead to immense damage per second. Timing plays a huge part as well when casting the Glintblade Phalanx at the right moment. Basically, the positioning of the bosses and enemies is always one of the factors to consider if you will use the follow-up attack or your R2 charge attacks.

This build explores the following talismans, the Axe Talisman and Shard of Alexander for further damage increase overall, especially for charge attacks. Assassin Cerulean Dagger works wonders as well since you will be refunding the FP used from Glintblade Phalanx every time you land a critical strike. Lastly, armed with Spear Talismans for a further boost of your Guard Counters since you can guard by using the Claymore.

On the other hand, since this build involves Academy Glintstone Staff and having 50 intelligence, you do have options to add more spells but we suggest keeping it to a minimum so you can maximize the original build setup of the Spellblade.

 
ELDEN RING RIME RONIN BUILD (ALL GAME)
A Dexterity/Intelligence build that uses the Nagakiba and the Chilling Mist Ash of War.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP
Weapon: Nagakiba & Black Bow
Shield: None
Armor: Zamor Set or any that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Bull-Goat's Talisman and Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Chilling Mist
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll lead off with Chilling Mist, using it to set the Frostbite Status Effect on your target, while simultaneously buffing your Cold Nagakiba with even more Frostbite Build up. Frostbite will allow you to deal more damage to your target, while ripping off 10% of the targets max HP. 

You can use the Black Bow in 2 ways. First you can use it with Fire Arrows to remove the Frostbite Status Effect so you can reapply it and take another 10% HP of the target. This doesn't always make sense when the target doesn't have much health remaining or it's just easier to have the increased damage buff from Frostbite, so you won't do this all the time.

The second use is by using Cold Bone Arrows to help set the Frostbite Status Effect at range, either after you've stripped it off or leading with it in a fight to get some Frostbite built up before you use Chilling Mist.

 

 
ELDEN RING MAGE BUILD (BEGINNER)
A pure ranged Build that focuses on ranging enemies down from afar, without the need to ever engage in melee combat.

Class: Astrologer
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, with 1 or 2 HP
Weapon: Any Staff, any melee weapon
Shield: Any 100% Physical Block
Armor: Any Light Armor
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Ash of War: Glintblade Phalanx
Spells: Glintstone Pebble, Glintstone Arc, Loretta's Greatbow, Great Glintstone Shard, Carian Slicer, Carian Piercer
Glintstone Pebble is your bread and butter and has longer range than Great Glintstone Shard, but less damage. Good for thinning out enemies.

Glintstone Arc is good for packs, but is very situational, and shouldn't be used much.

Loretta's Greatbow is your long range high damage ability that can be charged for even more damage. Use this to hit enemies very far away that are dangerous.

Carian Slicer is great for fights where you can't stay at range because it's too dangerous or when enemies are very aggressive.

Carian Piercer is great for invaders and NPC invaders, and can keep you safe.

Ash of War: Glintstone Phalanx does incredible damage if you upgrade your melee weapon. It also staggers enemies easily, allowing critical attacks. Use it on aggressive enemies.

 
ELDEN RING SORCERER BUILD
Note: since patch 1.03, Determination no longer applies its buff to any source of damage other than the weapon to which the Ash of War is applied. It can no longer be used to increase the damage of sorceries or incantations. The written guide below has been updated and contains minor changes to the build in the video guide.

An advancement of the Mage Build showcasing what to use next and where to go in terms of a caster only type of Build around level 50 or so.

Class: Astrologer or Prisoner
Flask Spread: Mostly FP some HP
Weapon: Meteorite Staff
Shield: Any 100% Physical Block
Armor: Queen's Crescent Crown & the heaviest Armor you can wear and still med roll
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Dexterity
Skills: Determination
Spells: Glintstone Pebble, Glintstone Arc, Great Glintstone Shard, Loretta's Greatbow & Rock Sling
Acquiring the Meteorite Staff will greatly increase your damage, and you'll be using this staff until much higher Intelligence levels. On your other hand, you can use a shield to block and perhaps parry, or some light weapon -like a dagger- with a useful Ash of War.

Glintstone Pebble will be your bread and butter to pick off enemies through out levels, and even works well against some Bosses because of its long range. Glintstone Arc is a highly situational AoE spell that can be used against groups of enemies.

Great Glintstone Shard is great when you need to kill something fast, dealing about 45% more damage than Pebble and travelling a slightly longer distance, but with a higher FP cost. The higher FP cost makes it suboptimal at these low levels for killing normal enemies, but works great against bosses.

Loretta's Longbow is used when you need extreme range to take out a dangerous foe and can be used to cheese many enemies in the game by staying just outside their aggro range and casting it.

Lastly, Rock Sling is used against enemies that are resistant to Magic Damage, because it deals Physical Damage, making it great in the Liurnia of the Lakes area. The spell inflicts damage in a small AoE and has tracking, PvE enemies that try to dodge will still be hit as they will dodge too soon. Rock Sling's damage is boosted by Meteorite Staff since it's a Gravity Sorcery, making it an excellent spell overall. Take note that this spell might not work in overly tight areas, as the rocks might collide with terrain and get destroyed before hitting your enemy.

 

 
ELDEN RING SPELLBLADE BUILD
A melee-focused Mage Build that uses magic to enhance and deal damage up close to enemies.

Class: Prisoner
Flask Spread: Split evenly between HP and FP
Weapon: Demi-Human Queen's Staff and Estoc or Rapier (Can be any Dex one-handed weapon)
Shield: Any 100% Physical (optional)
Armor: Any, but get pieces that increase Intelligence when possible
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Dexterity & Mind
Skills: Ash of War: Impaling Thrust
Spells: Scholar's Armament, Glintstone Pebble and Carian Slicer
The way this Build works is that you'll buff your Rapier or Estoc with Scholar's Armament to double your melee damage or so early on, allowing you to one or two shot most enemies. Make sure that you have both your Staff and Weapon out at the same time or you won't be able to buff it. You can use Glintstone Pebble to thin enemies when their are many to prevent yourself from being swarmed, and also to hit enemies that you can't get to physically.

Carian Slicer is your money maker and makes short work of Bosses and challenging enemies. You'll spam this repeatedly when you get openings to melt Boss HP. It's absolutely devastating. Just know that you deal almost no Stagger with this Spell so you will have to read enemy ques and dodge when they begin to retaliate.

You can use a Shield in some scenarios where Blocking is beneficial, but it rarely is since it drains your Stamina when Blocking and you need it to attack rapidly with Carian Slicer.

 
ELDEN RING MAGUS BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A melee-mage Build that uses Scholar's Armament and Glintstone Phalanx to deal Critical Damage to enemies.

Class: Prisoner or Astrologer
Flask Spread: Slightly more FP than HP
Weapon: Rapier
Shield: None
Armor: Carian Knight Set
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Ash of War: Glintblade Phalanx
Spells: Scholar's Armament, Glintstone Pebble and Carian Greatsword
The way this Build works is that you'll buff your Rapier with Scholar's Armament and then hit L2 to use Glintstone Phalanx. Make sure you use the Keen version of this Ash of War or you won't be able to buff it!

Glintstone Phalanx usually staggers enemies in one or two bursts, so be ready to deal Critical Damage with your Rapier which has a Critical Rating of 130 which is pretty damn good. This allows you to kill tough enemies easily.

Use Glintstone Pebble to thin out enemies or to reach enemies you cannot get with melee attacks, or on horseback as necessary.

Use Carian Greatsword when outnumbered or when on horseback to dispatch enemies easily.

 

 
ELDEN RING ENCHANTED KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A medium-armor melee-based sorcerer Build that allows you to Block with a Shield while attacking with Carian Sword Sorceries in your right hand.

Class: Astrologer or Prisoner
Flask Spread: Most FP, Some HP
Weapon: Carian Glintstone Staff
Shield: Blue-Gold Kite Shield
Armor: Carian Knight Set
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind & Endurance
Skills: Ash of War: Barricade Shield
Spells: Carian Slicer, Carian Piercer, Carian Greatsword and Glintstone Pebble
You need to have a well rounded stat spread for this Build since you are playing it like a melee character that uses a Shield, so good Vigor and Endurance helps with Blocking and taking damage. Make sure you have enough Intelligence to deal damage, but don't go crazy and leave your character vulnerable. You will be in melee range so you will get hit.

When facing tough enemies buff with Barricade Shield to reduce the Stamina consumption of Blocking so that you have more Stamina to use Carian Slicer or Carian Greatsword.

Spam Carian Slicer to melt bosses and tough enemies and use Carian Greatsword when mounted or when getting too close to some enemies is risky. Use Carian Piercer against NPC Invaders, and use Glintstone Pebble to tackle flying enemies or enemies you cannot reach with melee attacks.

 
ELDEN RING MOONVEIL SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A melee-mage Build that uses Transient Moonlight to stagger enemies and deal critical damage.

Class: Prisoner or Samurai
Flask Spread: Slightly more HP than FP
Weapon: Moonveil
Shield: None
Armor: Land of Reeds Set
Primary Stats: Intelligence &Vigor
Secondary Stats: Dexterity
Skills: Transient Moonlight
Spells: Loretta's Greatbow, Glintstone Pebble and Carian Greatsword
The way this Build works is that you use Transient Moonlight with R2 instead of R1 to stagger enemies and then critically strike them. Using the Assassin's Cerulean Dagger and Carian Filigreed Crest recovers the cost of using Transient Moonlight so that you never run out of FP.

Use Loretta's Greatbow to take out difficult enemies at range, and use Glintstone Pebble to do the same when they aren't quite as far away.

Carian Greatsword is used to AoE enemies that are grouped up, and is benefited by Radagon Icon.

 

 
ELDEN RING SWORD SAGE BUILD (LEVEL 50)
The Sword Sage is a combination of Intelligence and Faith, using the Sword of Night and Flame and Death Sorceries.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between FP & HP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame & Meteorite Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still lets you med roll
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame Stance
Spells: Rancorcall & Ancient Death Rancor
The way this Build works is that you increase your Intelligence and Faith high enough to use Sword of Night and Flame and Ancient Death Rancor, which requires 34 Int and 24 Faith.

Sword of Night and Flame has an amazing Weapon Art that allows you to do a Comet-like beam with L2 and R1 that does insane damage and has great range. L2 and R2 is a flame strike in an AoE in front of you that can wipe out packs of enemies.

Rancorcall and Ancient Death Rancor require Intelligence and Faith to use, so are a natural fit here. Meteorite Staff is not the ideal staff to use here, and you'll want to swap this out for Prince of Death's Staff once you get it, as it scales off both Int and Faith. It also boosts the damage of Death Sorceries, which both of these are.

Ancient Death Rancor does incredible stagger damage to enemies, allowing you to pin them down if you spam this, which is fantastic solo and in co op play. It's particularly good against fast moving enemies and bosses that are hard to hit with Sword of Night and Flame's Weapon arts

 
ELDEN RING DARKMOON SPELLBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A melee mage build that focuses on the use of the Dark Moon Greatsword and other Glintblade Sorceries to destroy its enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Dark Moon Greatsword & Carian Glintblade Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows med rolling
Talismans: Godfrey Icon, Radagon Icon, Stargazer Heirloom & Green Turtle Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Moonlight Greatsword
Spells: Magic Glintblade, Glintstone Pebble, Greatblade Phalanx, Loretta's Greatbow & Unseen Form
Generally how this Build works is that you'll sent up your combo of either Magic Glintblade & Moonlight Greatsword or Greatblade Phalanx & Moonlight Greatsword against enemies depending on what you are facing (Magic Glintblade for weaker ones, Greatblade Phalanx for tougher ones).

It generally goes something like this, buff your Greatsword with L2, cast Magic Glintblade or Greatblade Phalanx and then either hold R2 or charge forward into range and then hold R2 and then hit R2 again. You're trying to time it so that the wave from the Greatsword connects with the enemy around the same time as the spell, or just before, so that the spell staggers after the wave, allowing you an opening for a second wave.

You can use Unseen Form to help you navigate levels, avoiding ranged enemies that might hit you unsuspectingly, allowing you to range them down with Glintstone Pebble or Magic Glintblade.

Loretta's Greatbow is there for very long range when the situation calls for it. Sometimes you just need a bit of range, and this spell single handedly takes care of that.

 

 
ELDEN RING BATTLEMAGE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A melee mage Build that uses Sorceries as their only means of damage while wielding a Shield in their off-hand to protect themselves and buff their damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Carian Glintstone Staff 
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Any that can med roll
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Mind, Vigor & Strength
Skills: Contagious Fury 
Spells: Carian Slicer, Carian Greatsword, Carian Piercer, Glintstone Pebble, Loretta's Greatbow
The way this Build works is that you use the Jellyfish Shield in your left hand and the Carian Glintstone Staff in your right, and use Carian Slicer as your melee attack. It's cheaper than Glintstone Pebble, allowing you to use it nearly twice as much, helping to preserve FP.

You can use your Jellyfish Shield to Block effectively, and also use its Skill: Contagious Fury to boost your damage by 20% for 30 seconds, including your Spell Damage. This lets you defeat enemies more easily, and sometimes gives you just enough damage to one shot enemies with Glintstone Pebble. Although, you will need some strength to wield it, and your stamina will run out very quickly if you play too defensive with it.

Carian Greatsword is there for AoE when needed, and Loretta's Greatbow is there for long range damage as necessary. Having these options makes you much more flexible, which a Battlemage should be in my opinion.

 
ELDEN RING DEATHBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
An Intelligence/Faith Build thas uses the Sword of Night and Flame to full effect, while also using both Sorceries and Incantations to dispatch enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame, Prince of Death's Staff & Golden Order Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that allows you to med roll. Spellblade Set boosts Night and Flame's Magic attack by 2% per piece
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Magic Scorpion Charm,, Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1 & Godfrey Icon
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame Stance
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Black Flame, Loretta's Greatbow, Terra Magica, Magic Glintblade, Ancient Death Rancor
The way this Build works is that you'll prioritize using the magic attack of Sword of Night and Flame, by using things that boost its damage, as well as the damage of your regular weapon attacks. Magic Scorpion Charm, Golden Vow, Spellblade Set and Terra Magica all boost this damage, making it much more deadly. You can still use the Flame attack when you want as well, but you'll buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength instead of Terra Magica when using it to boost Fire Damage instead of magic.

You also deal incredible damage just with regular melee attacks, as the Sword of Night and Flame has one of the highest Attack Ratings in Elden Ring. If you can get someone to drop you a second one, consider dual wielding them for even more deadly melee attacks.

You'll supplement your melee attacks and weapon skills with magic, most notably Black Flame when you need some mid range Fire Damage, or Magic Glintblade when you need mid range Magic Damage. You'll use Loretta's Greatbow to take out things from really long range, and Ancient Death Rancor is there to stagger enemies and Bosses (particularly those that you can target the head), giving you an opening to use Sword of Night and Flame's Skills.

 

 
ELDEN RING CRYSTAL MAGE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
The Crystal Mage Build is an Intelligence focused Build that uses Crystal and Glintstone Sorceries to dispatch enemies at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Crystal Staff, Finger Seal or Clawmark Seal
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Any that still allows you to med roll
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Dragoncrest Shield Talisman, and Godfrey Icon
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Contagious Fury
Spells: Crystal Torrent, Shattering Crystal, Glintstone Pebble, Great Glintstone Shard, Comet, Terra Magica & Bestial Vitality
This Build uses the Crystal Staff to boost the damage of both Crystal Torrent and Shattering Crystal. Lusat's Glintstone Staff costs too much FP to use consistently, and we don't meet the requirements to use Carian Regal Staff yet, so this is the next best one when it comes to scaling.

You'll use Contagious Fury by keeping your Shield in your left hand, buffing your spell damage by 20% for 30 seconds when you use it. This helps range things down more easily, and it has a short animation, allowing you to use it rather easily in boss encounters.

Use Shattering Crystal to AoE and against big enemies, as they get hit by the most Crystals. Crystal Torrent is there to melt bosses and enemies at good range, and when combined with Terra Magica, it can kill most enemies and some Bosses in a single cast.

Glintstone Pebble and Great Glinstone Shard are there for trash enemies, while Comet can be used on the more difficult ones, where using Crystal Torrent is not possible due to its long animation. It can be held down for even longer range, allowing you to hit distant enemies effectively.

Bestial Vitality is there for a small heal over time to restore health to reactive Ritual Sword Talisman when you reach full HP, increasing your damage by 10% once again.

 
ELDEN RING FROST KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 100)
The Frost Knight Build is a melee focused Build that uses the Ice Spear Ash of War to deal Magic Damage at range, and to set the Frostbite Status Effect reliably on enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Clayman's Harpoon & any Staff
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Any that still allows you to med roll
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Carian Filigreed Crest, Curved Sword Talisman & Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Ice Spear & Carian Retaliation
Spells: Scholar's Shield, Terra Magica, Magic Glintblade, Greatblade Phalanx & Scholar's Armament
This Build uses Ice Spear to add even more Magic Damage to the Clayman's Harpoon, and to range down enemies from a distance. It also sets the Frostbite Status Effect with enough hits, wiping out a chunk of enemy HP, increasing the damage they take, and reducing their Stamina recovery.

Additionally, Ice Spear does tons of Stance damage at range, allowing you to break enemy stances easily, allowing for frequent critical attacks. When combined with Block Counters, that also do very high stance damage, you can soften enemies up as they approach and then finish them with Block Counters or stagger them and then finish them.

Scholar's Shield will make the Carian Knight Shield nearly 100% Magic Resistant, allowing you to block magic attacks with ease. And on top of that it, boosts your Guard Boost by 25%, allowing you to block attacks more easily. It's not a bad replacement for Barricade Shield (post 1.03 patch) if you can get your Guard Boost high enough, which is why we use the Greatshield Talisman.

Terra Magica is there to buff your damage in fights where you can setup beforehand, just make sure to remain in its area to gain increased damage. You can use Scholar's Armament if you went Standard or Heavy on your weapon instead of Cold or Frost to further buff your damage.

Magic Glintblade is there for a longer range option, and Greatblade Phalanx is useful for stagger damage.

 

 
ELDEN RING MOONVEIL SHINOBI BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A melee-mage Build that uses Transient Moonlight and Glintstone Phalanx to stagger enemies and to set both Hemorrhage and Frostbite on them.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Slightly more HP than FP
Weapon: Moonveil, Uchigatana and any Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Any that can still med roll
Talismans: Carian Filigree Crest, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Magic Scorpion Charm, & Green Turtle Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence &Vigor
Secondary Stats: Dexterity & Mind
Skills: Transient Moonlight & Glinstone Phalanx
Spells: Loretta's Greatbow, Great Glintstone Shard, and Terra Magica
The way this Build works is that you will swap to your Cold Uchigatana and throw up Glinstone Phalanx before swapping back to dual wield. You'll move to melee range using L2 and R2 to use Transient Moonlight, staggering enemies with the combination of both the Phalanx and Moonveil as they hit at roughly the same time. You may not need both, but this is the play for tougher enemies and bosses. Once downed, spam L1 to set Hemorrhage and Frostbite on the target to finish them off  quickly.

Use Loretta's Greatbow to take out difficult enemies at range, and use Great Glinstone Shard to do the same when they aren't quite as far away, as it has been patched since 1.03 to be much better.

Make sure to Critically Strike enemies you stagger to regain FP if they are not Bosses, since you likely won't need to spam dual wield attacks to finish them off.

 
ELDEN RING COLD-BLOODED RAPTOR BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Strength/Intelligence Build that uses Claws to deal damage rapidly, and to also set the Hemorrhage and Frostbite status effects.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Bloodhound Claws, Sacrificial Axe & Academy Glintstone Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers, Haima Glintstone Crown and any other gloves and legs that allow you to med roll
Talismans: Lord of Blood's Exultation, Claw Talisman, Green Turtle Talisman & Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Strength & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Royal Knight's Resolve & Golden Vow
Spells: Great Glintstone Shard, Loretta's Greatbow, Terra Magica, Adula's Moonblade, Greatblade Phalanx
The way this Build works is that you'll two hand your Claws, which brings out a second one and buff with Royal Knight's Resolve to boost the damage with both Claws. This is possible because they are only considered one Weapon, and buffs both Claws. You'll then Jump Attack enemies or bosses for increased damage, finishing them off with R1 attacks if they survive. Keep the Sacrificial Axe in your left hand to regain 4 FP per kill, even when dual wielding your Claws.

You'll build up Hemorrhage and Frostbite on anything that doesn't die in a few hits, ripping off huge chunks of HP rapidly, making your damage output very high.

You can supplement your melee playstyle with spells to give you ranged attacks, though they will be less powerful than a pure mage Build. Still you have options depending on the situation, and Greatblade Phalanx is fantastic as it works well with a melee playstyle and helps to stagger enemies.

 

 
ELDEN RING DARK KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence Build that power stances Greatswords to great effect, dealing high magic and physical damage in melee and at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Helphen's Steeple, Dark Moon Greatsword & Staff of Loss
Shield: None
Armor: Night's Cavalry Set
Talismans: Claw Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm (or Ritual Sword Talisman), Great-Jar's Arsenal & Primal Glintstone Blade
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Moonlight Greatsword & Ruinous Ghostflame
Spells: Night Comet, Night Shard, Terra Magica & Loretta's Greatbow
The way this Build works is that you will power stance Helphen's Steeple and Dark Moon Greatsword, with Steeple in your right hand and Dark Moon in your left. You'll buff with Moonlight Greatsword, and then buff with Ruinous Ghostflame and then do primarily jump attacks on enemies to kill most regular enemies in one attack. Some more difficult enemies may take more.

You can rebuff easily because Ruinous Ghostflame has a modest cast time, and it only lasts half as long as Moonlight Greatsword, so you'll need to use it twice for every one cast of Moonlight. You may not be able to rebuff with Moonlight in tough fights, but you absolutely should with Ruinous in order to gain more Frost build up.

You can swap our Steeple for Staff of Loss when you need to cast Night Comet or Night Shard, to range down enemies where it's easier to do. You can swap back and forth as necessary, maybe even multiple times during the same fight.

(Patch 1.07 decreases the status buildup on dual wielded weapons.)

 
ELDEN RING ELEMENTALIST BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence/Faith Build that can cast nearly any spell in the game, and only uses ranged magic to destroy enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Prince of Death's Staff & Golden Order Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Green Turtle Talisman, Marika's Soreseal, Ritual Sword Talisman, & Primal Glintstone Blade
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: None
Spells: Stone of Gurranq, Lightning Spear, Black Flame, Catch Flame, Great Glintstone Shard, Triple Rings of Light, & Golden Vow
The way this Build works is that you will use Prince of Death's Staff to cast Sorceries and Golden Order Seal to cast Incantations. You'll buff with Golden Vow to increase your spell damage, as well as boost your defenses. Then you'll select the spell that's best suited for the situation.

Stone of Guarranq is your ranged Physical Damage spell that can be chained effectively at modest range. You can also use Rock Sling, but it casts slower, though it does have longer range and does more stagger damage.

Lightning Spear is your Lightning Damage spell that you'll use to take out enemies weak to Lightning. You can charge it for extra damage as needed and it does +10% damage in the rain.

Black Flame is your ranged Fire Damage spell that deals that can be charged for extra damage, and also does a small damage over time based on the max HP of the enemy. Catch Flame is used in melee situations where enemies are so aggressive you can't cast spells. Catch Flame is cast quickly after you roll or sprint, allowing you to "melee" enemies with it.

Great Glintstone Shard is your ranged spell that has good range and average damage and can be spammed. You can use other Magic Damage spells as well like Loretta's Greatbow for more range, or you can use Comet for a more spammable higher damage Great Glintstone Shard.

Triple Rings of Light is your go to Holy Damage spell that has a modest range and good spread. Litany of  Proper Death is a great AoE that annihilates undead and prevents them from respawning.

 

 
ELDEN RING FREEZING BATTLEMAGE BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A melee mage build that uses Carian Slicer and other Carian Sword Sorceries to their fullest!

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Lusat's Glintstone Staff & Carian Glintstone Staff
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Snow Witch Hat, and any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Graven-School Talisman, Graven-Mass Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm & Ritual Sword Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Mind & Vigor
Skills: Contagious Fury
Spells: Carian Slicer, Adula's Moonblade, Carian Piercer, Glintstone Icecrag, Zamor Ice Storm and Freezing Mist
The way this Build works is that you'll use Carian Slicer to its fullest by casting it with Lusat's Glintstone Staff and wielding Carian Glintstone Staff in the other hand or by using Contagious Fury from the Jellyfish Shield. Lusat's Glintstone Staff increases FP cost by 50%, but Carian Slicer only costs 6 FP to begin with, so you can get away with it here in order to boost damage.

You'll use Adula's Moonblade for larger enemies that are hard to hit with Carian Slicer and for AoE groups, and the damage of this Spell and all Cold Sorceries is boosted by 10% because of the Snow Witch Hat.

Carian Piercer is there for NPC invaders or actual invaders, as it has incredible hit boxes, and allows you to roll catch easily. Glinstone Icecrag is your ranged option that helps build up Frostbite, and deals decent damage, but is slow and doesn't have great range. You could swap this for Great Glintstone Shard if you want.

Freezing Mist is used to set Frostbite on tough enemies or Bosses to reduce their damage absorption, allowing you to deal more Magic Damage with your spells.

You can also add Zamor Ice Storm to this build, for its increased attack power and status buildup after patch 1.07.

 
ELDEN RING CARIAN SPELLKNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence Build that uses the Carian Grandeur to one shot difficult tough enemies and some Bosses.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Longsword & Carian Regal Scepter
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Carian Knight Helm & Spellblades Set
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Godfrey Icon, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Carian Grandeur
Spells: Terra Magica, Greatblade Phalanx, Loretta's Greatbow, Scholar's Shield, Great Glinstone Shard, Rykard's Rancor, & Founding Rain of Stars
The way this Build works is that you'll use your Shield to Block Counter regular enemies around the landscape. You'll use Carian Grandeur to one shot anything that's more difficult, and you can use Loretta's Greatbow and Great Glintstone Shard to pick things off at range as necessary.

Greatblade Phalanx is used to help stagger an enemy when connecting with Carian Grandeur close to the time it lands. You can use Terra Magica to buff your Magic Damage before a tough fight if you have time, making you even more deadly.

Founding Rain of Stars works well for larger enemies, or those that aren't extremely mobile, like Dragons or Godskin Noble. Rykard's Rancor gives you a high damage Fire Spell you can use when enemies are highly magic resistant.

 

 
ELDEN RING DEATH KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence Build that uses the Sword of Night and Flame and Shield as well as some Death Sorceries

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame, Carian Regal Scepter & Frenzied Flame Seal
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Night's Cavalry Helm, Night's Cavalry Armor, Lionel's Greaves, & Lionel's Gauntlets
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Great-Jar's Arsenal, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger & Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame-Stance
Spells: Rancor, Ancient Death Rancor, Golden Vow, & Terra Magica
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and use Rancor and Sword of Night and Flame to take on regular enemies, using Carian Knight's Shield to Block Counter as needed.

You'll swap to Ancient Death Rancor for more difficult enemies, and you'll use the Night Comet ability of Sword of Night and Flame to finish them of while they are staggered from Ancient Death Rancor. 

If you can get the drop on a tough enemy or Boss, you'll place Terra Magica down first to boost your Magic Damage even further, before unloading with Ancient Death Rancor, and then firing off the Night Comet ability of Night and Flame when they get close to you.

 
ELDEN RING ROYAL KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Strength/Intelligence Build that uses the Royal Greatsword and Clayman's Harpoon to set Frostbite and destroy enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Royal Greatsword & Clayman's Harpoon
Shield: Eclipse Greatshield
Armor: Haima Glintstone Crown & any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Radagon's Soreseal, Great-Jar's Arsenal & Carian Filigreed Crest
Primary Stats: Strength & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Wolf's Assault & Ice Spear
Spells: Scholar's Shield (optional)
The way this Build works is that you'll swap between using the Royal Greatsword and Clayman's Harpoon depending on the circumstances, while Blocking with your Eclipse Greatshield and using Guard Counters for massive damage and Critical Attacks.

Wolf's Assault does devastating damage if you can land the first hit, and the AoE will often one shot groups of enemies, and both of these hits build up Frostbite, though the normal weapon attacks of the Royal Greatsword do not.

You can swap to the Clayman's Harpoon, using the Cold version for better Strength scaling, and to help set the Frostbite status effect more easily. You'll use Ice Spear with it to range enemies when needed, using to Stance Break enemies by filling their stagger meter now and then.

You can buff with Scholar's Shield if you want to equip a staff, which further boosts the Guard Boost and damage negation of your Shield, making you damn near invincible while Blocking. Keep in mind you can use Clayman's Harpoon to Block and attack at the same time, so it's a good strategy against enemies you are having a hard time with.

 

 
ELDEN RING MOONLIGHT CRUSADER BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence Build that uses the Dark Moon Greatsword and spells to range down enemies from a distance.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Dark Moon Greatsword & Carian Regal Scepter
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Godfrey Icon, Magic Scorpion Charm & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Moonlight Greatsword
Spells: Ranni's Dark Moon, Greatblade Phalanx, Terra Magica & Comet
The way this Build works is that you'll be using the Moonlight Greatsword ability of the Dark Moon Greatsword to change the R2 attack into a wave that can stagger enemies at range when fully charged. This wave deals 100% Magic Damage, which is why we pump Intelligence very high with this Build, even though the Greatsword can scale with other stats. 

Casting Greatblade Phalanx and then hitting with a fully-charged wave from Moonlight Greatsword will stagger most enemies and some Bosses. This combination is extremely deadly and you should use it as much as possible when facing difficult enemies.

Terra Magica boosts all Magic Damage when standing inside its area of effect, so this includes Moonlight Greatsword and any melee attacks you do while inside it, since the Greatsword does some Magic Damage as well. Use this to boost your damage when needed.

Lastly, hitting Bosses with Ranni's Dark Moon will debuff them and can even trigger Frostbite, further reducing the protection they have. Use this first when beginning Boss fights when possible.

 
ELDEN RING METEOR MAGE BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence Mage Build that uses Gravity Sorceries that deal both Physical and Magic Damage to cataclysmic effect.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Carian Regal Scepter, Meteorite Staff, & Frenzied Flame Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Light Armor
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm, Godfrey Icon & Graven-Mass Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Spinning Weapon
Spells: Collapsing Stars, Gravity Well, Rock Sling, Meteorite, Meteorite of Astel
The way this Build works is that you'll hold the Meteorite Staff in your left hand in order to give you a passive increase to Gravity Sorcery damage (+30%). You'll then cast with the Carian Regal Scepter in your right hand because it has better Sorcery Scaling at higher Intelligence levels. This makes your Gravity Sorceries hit extremely hard.

You'll use Collapsing Stars and Gravity Well for trash enemies as these are easiest to use in these type of encounters, and remember these spells PULL enemies towards you. You can pull them off edges or down to you, and then hit them with Spinning Weapon to finish them off if needed. Both these spells deal Magic Damage and can be charged, so benefit from Magic Scorpion Charm and Godfrey Icon. Charge them when you can.

Rock Sling is there when you need Physical Damage, or are trying to stagger a Boss. It's hard to use in close quarters so it's very situational.

Meteorite and Meteorite of Astel are used to take down large packs of enemies or large Bosses that have huge hit boxes. Hold down the spell to continue dropping Meteors on them. Use the Cerulean Hidden Tear to remove the FP cost of these spells for 10 seconds when slotted into your Flask of Wonderous Physick. This will allow you to nuke them for a very long time without FP concerns. Meteorite of Astel casts many more Meteors, but costs way more FP.

 

 
ELDEN RING NEBULA KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Intelligence Build that uses the Wing of Astel to great effect by capitalizing on its weapon skill Nebula.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Wing of Astel and any Staff
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Scaled Armor Set or any Armor with high Poise
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Shard of Alexander, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Curved Sword Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Nebula
Spells: Scholar's Shield & Terra Magica
The Nebula Knight Build uses a combination of Block Counters and the weapon skill of Wing of Astel: Nebula to handle any situation effectively. Because Wing of Astel scales well with both Dexterity and Intelligence, we don't use a Great Shield for this Build, due to low Strength. Carian Knight's Shield is an excellent choice for those using a Shield with no Strength investment. And because Scholar's Shield further increases its mitigations and Guard Boost, it only gets even more effective.

Wing of Astel has a unique R2 attack and charged R2 attack that fires 1 or 2 waves of magic forward, depending on whether you charged it or not. These waves deal 100% Magic Damage (just like Nebula), making them benefit greatly from Magic Scorpion as well as Terra Magica. The waves, however, do not benefit from the Axe Talisman, though the damage you deal with the sword itself does. These waves also increase in damage based on your Intelligence, making it imperative for this Build.

Nebula is really your go to for Boss encounters, and it shoots out star clusters in front of you that explode dealing Magic Damage. They group up in tight spaces, but fan out in open locations. You can cast Nebula and then follow up with a Charged R2 for great stagger damage, or just spam Nebula.

 
ELDEN GOLDEN SWORD SAGE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Faith/Intelligence Build that focuses on the use of Holy Damage and Golden Order Incantations.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Coded Sword, Sword of Night and Flame, and Golden Order Seal
Shield: Blue-Gold Kite Shield
Armor: Radiant Gold Mask, and any Armor with high Poise.
Talismans: Sacred Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Ritual Shield Talisman, & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Faith & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Unblockable Blade & Barricade Shield
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree, Discus of Light, Triple Rings of Light, Radagon's Rings of Light, Elden Stars & Litany of Proper Death.
The way this Build works is that you'll be wielding the Coded Sword, which deals 100% Holy Damage and only scales with Faith. You'll use Sacred Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman and Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear to boost its damage. Use Unblockable Blade for a small cluster of enemies, or against Bosses or enemies that use Shields.

Discus of Light is your go to offensive Golden Order Incantation, and its boosted in damage by Sacred Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Holy-Shrouded Cracked Tear, Golden Order Seal and Radiant Gold Mask. You could even slot Flock's Canvas Talisman for more damage if you wish. You can chain spam this spell to deal with many enemies and Bosses from a distance.

Triple Rings of Light is used to deal with enemies that dodge when you fling spells, like Black Knife Assassins, Bloodhound Knights, or Godskin Apostles. It deals slightly more damage than Discus of Light on average, but costs about 3x the FP, so I don't advise using it regularly.

Radagon's Rings of Light is a fantastic AoE spell that can wipe out huge packs of enemies, especially if you hold down the cast button, since this further increases range. This can be used from horseback as well, and if it doesn't kill enemies, it will knock them down allowing for easy follow up casts. It has further range and damage than Wrath of Gold, and is also boosted by Golden Order Seal and Radiant Gold Mask.

Elden Stars is your super long range spell that's good at picking off enemies from a long distance, or harassing Bosses while you attack with other spells or Unblockable Blade. You won't use it often, but it's nice to have when you need it.

Litany of Proper Death you will only use against Undead enemies, so only slot this when you need it. And Golden Vow is there to increase damage and defenses further, and Blessing of the Eerdtree is there to keep your HP topped off to proc the effects of Ritual Sword and Ritual Shield Talismans.

Sword of Knight and Flame is useful against Holy Damage resistant enemies, and you should sub this in when needed. Be sure to swap out Sacred Scorpion Charm for Magic or Fire, and to replace Holy-Shrouded Cracked Tear with Magic or Fire as well. Shard of Alexander is also a nice addition here.

 

 
ELDEN SOUL SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity Intelligence Build that uses the Nagakiba and Scholar's Armament to phenomenal result.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Nagakiba & Academy Glintstone Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Black Knife Set
Talismans: Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Magic Scorpion Charm & Millicent's Prosthesis
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Double Slash
Spells: Greatblade Phalanx, Founding Rain of Stars, Unseen Form, Loretta's Greatbow, Carian Retaliation, Scholar's Armament, Terra Magica, Freezing Mist
The way this Build works is that you'll use Unseen Form and the Black Knife Set to sneak up on enemies getting easy backstabs and attacks. These two things will muffle your sound and make you harder to see.

You can use Greatblade Phalanx when you know enemies are going to come at you, and cast Freezing Mist on tough enemies and Bosses to soften up their defenses via the Frostbite status effect.

Cast Founding Rain of Stars at the beginning of Boss fights when they start to come at you, and try to fight around the AoE it creates for best results. Try to dodge and use Double Slash while they are still in the AoE of FRoS.

Loretta's Greatbow is useful for situations where you need some long range or things will be markedly more difficult, and you can use Carian Retaliation to parry projectiles, which is great.

Scholar's Armament is your buff to really boost your damage over the top of a magic infused or cold infused Nagakiba. By keeping it Keen and using Scholar's Armament you will have higher damage potential as long as it remanis buffed.

 
ELDEN RING DEATH MAGE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A mage build that focuses on the use of Death Sorceries and the Prince of Death Staff.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split FP & HP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame, Golden Order Seal & Prince of Death Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll.
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Graven-Mass Talisman, Ritual Sword Talisman & Godfrey Icon or Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame Stance
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Rancorcall, Ancient Death Rancor, Explosive Ghostflame. Terra Magica & Rykard's Rancor
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and then cast Rancorcall on regular trash enemies, using Explosive Ghostflame or Rykard's Rancor on groups of enemies to AoE them down quickly.

Ancient Death Rancor is great against hard to kill enemies and Bosses, especially if you charge it and are standing in Terra Magica when you cast it. It can often stagger bosses or outright kill them before they ever reach you.

Rykard's Rancor gives you a fire option that you can use Flame, Grant Me Strength to buff as well as Fire Scorpion Charm. It's good against magic resistant enemies or those weak to fire.

Sword of Night and Flame is your melee option, since Rancorcall and Ancient Death Rancor are useless at point blank range as they will fly over the target and miss.

 

 
ELDEN RING WARRIOR WIZARD BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A melee mage build that focuses on destroying enemies up close with weapon spells.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP & FP
Weapon: Carian Regal Scepter, Lusat's Glintstone Staff, & Carian Glintstone Staff
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Beast Champion Set & Greathelm
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Graven-Mass Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, & Radagon Icon
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind & Endurance
Skills: None
Spells: Terra Magica, Gavel of Haima, Loretta's Greatbow, Carian Slicer, Carian Piercer, Carian Greatsword, & Adula's Moonblade
The way this Build works is that you'll main using Carian Slicer as your primary attack using the Carian Regal Scepter in your right hand to cast, and Carian Glintstone Staff in your left to buff its damage. You can swap to Carian Greatsword or Adula's Moonblade for packs of enemies, giving you solid AoE.

 

Loretta's Greatbow is there for a ranged option in case you need to pick off an enemy or two safely, and you can drop Terra Magica before using it to boost your damage further.

Gavel of Haima can be chained if you cast with alternating staffs, R1, L1, R1, L1 etc, allowing you to keep staggering an enemy or boss for modest damage. This makes guard breaks happen often, allowing you more opening to attack.

Use Lusat's Glintstone Staff for boss fights where you need more damage, and FP isn't an issue. In boss fights you want to kill as quickly as possible, so even 10% more damage is useful.

 
ELDEN RING SILENT SPEARCALLER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A stealth melee build that uses the Death Ritual Spear to range down targets or stab them to death up close.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Death Ritual Spear, Carian Regal Scepter & Staff of Loss
Shield: None
Armor: Black Knife Set (so your footsteps are muffled)
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Ritual Sword Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm, & Bull-Goat's Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Spearcall Ritual
Spells: Unseen Form, Night Comet, Night Shard, & Terra Magica
The way this Build works is that you'll buff yourself with Unseen Form, making you hard to see vs enemies. When this is combined with the Black Knife chest piece, enemies can also not hear you easily, so this allows you to sneak up on unsuspecting targets. You can then cast Night Shard, Night Comet or simply use Spearcall Ritual or backstab if you can get close enough.

Often times enemies might become aware that you've killed an ally, and come to investigate, but they usually won't see you if you move away quickly. This typically allows you another backstab, if you did one already, or to kill them using one of the afore mentioned Spells or abilities.

During Boss fights you won't be able to hide, so you'll need to drop Terra Magica and try to spam Spearcall Ritual as much as possible, or case Night Comet if more prudent. Either of these should allow you to range down targets before they get to close, but if they do, smack them with your Spear!

 

 
ELDEN RING GHOSTBLADE BUILD (ALL GAME)
Ghostblade is a quality build that utilizes Death's Poker and its unique weapon skill Ghostflame Ignition. This skill primarily scales with intelligence to heavy damage to targets. This build also utilizes Strength and Dexterity to effectively wield the Death Poker when dealing normal attacks to targets.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Death's Poker, Staff of Loss
Shield: Scorpion Kite Shield
Armor: Sanguine Noble Hood, Maliketh's Armor, Maliketh's Gauntlets, Maliketh's Greaves or any armor with high protection and 51+ Poise
Talismans: Warrior Jar Shard or Shard of Alexander, Magic Scorpion Charm, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Curved Sword Talisman & more suggested talismans in the video.
Primary Stats: Vigor, Strength, Dexterity & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Ghostflame Ignition
Spells: Terra Magica
Ghostblade build is a quality build that relies on a Death's Poker to deal with normal attacks to its enemies and even burst down bosses with its unique skill, the Ghostflame Ignition. Not only does this skill do heavy damage to targets, but it also builds up Frostbite leading to more possible damage. Paired up with Terra Magica Sorcery which further bolsters the skill's potency.

The way how this build behaves is the user will focus on using the Ghostflame Ignition as the main damage dealer to enemies. This skill can be utilized in two different ways, first after pressing R2, quickly pressing R1 will let the user cast a fire trail that continuously deals damage to enemies. The R1 variant of this skill is a great opener in boss fights or any other enemies since the target tries to close its distance to the user, it will already suffer damage over time from the flame trail and also build Frostbite.

The R2 variant of the skill will allow the user to cast an explosion that can affect nearby enemies and deal high damage to bosses. If timed correctly, the user casts the flame trail first and then sets up the R2 skill variant. Bosses will suffer from the skill's direct damage, flame trail damage over time, and Frostbite.

This build explores the following talismans, the Warrior Jar Shard or Shard of Alexander for further damage increase overall, Magic Scorpion Charm for even more damage since the Ghostflame Ignition scales purely with Intelligence, Dragoncrest Greatshield to offset the Magic Scorpion Charm 10% physical damage taken increase and lastly, Curved Sword Talisman to increase the guard counter damage of this build.

On the other hand, since the user is provided with a shield, guard counters are a suggested strategy when clearing regular enemies or when progressing in a dungeon. The allocated Strength and Dexterity will help the Ghostblade deal a decent amount of damage when performing regular attacks especially when conserving FP in the early stages of the build.

 

 

 
ELDEN RING RED LIGHTNING BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Faith Build that focuses on the use of Dragon Cult Incantations that deal Lightning Damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split FP & HP
Weapon: Erdtree Seal & Gravel Stone Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll.
Talismans: Lightning Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Flock's Canvas Talisman and Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Faith & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind
Skills: None
Spells: Golden Vow, Lightning Strike, Lightning Spear, Lansseax's Glaive, Frozen Lightning Spear, Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike
The way this Build works is that you'll only be casting Incantations for your damage, and all of these Spells deal Lightning Damage. You can of course sub in other spells against Lightning Resistant enemies, but Lightning in general is a pretty good damage type.

Lightning Strike is your bread and butter spell that can AoE enemies in a line and does fairly good damage. It only costs 1 FP more than Lightning Strike, and it can be chain cast rapidly after the first cast, allowing you to melt Bosses easily with it. It does, however, start slowly so you'd be better off with Lightning Spear against enemies that are more aggressive.

Lansseax's Glaive does like a sweet in front of you of Red Lightning and it deals damage in an AoE behind that. This Spell has hyper armor allowing you to tank through most hits and still get the cast off and is good against large groups of enemies or very fast enemies like the Tree Sentinels, Night's Cavalry and Bloodhound Knights, as their movements are erratic, making it difficult to land more target spells.

Frozen Lightning Spear is decent ranged option which is good for setting Frostbite on enemies, which increase the damage they take. This can help with Lightning Resistant enemies in general.

Ancient Dragons' Lightning Spear is excellent against large enemies as it tends to hit them with multiple columns further boosting the damage. Make sure you cast this when as close to them as possible for maximum effect.

 
ELDEN RING PERFECT PALADIN BUILD (ALL LEVELS)
A Strength/Faith Build that focuses on the use of Block Counters and buffs to slash enemies to pieces.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Miquellan Knight's Sword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: Haligtree Crest Greatshield
Armor: Haligtree Knight Set and Greathelm
Talismans: Bull-Goat's Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Curved Sword Talisman & Sacred Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Sacred Blade
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Blessing of the Erdtree
The way this Build works is that you'll use Golden Vow to buff your defense and damage, and then use your Greatshield to Block enemy attacks, following up with a Block Counter when necessary, staggering enemies and often giving you a free attack if you don't kill them outright.

Sacred Blade is exceptional since patch 1.07 and using it point blank will both deal damage with the weapon and the holy wave, making it deadly up close. It also buffs your weapon for more damage and for longer, allowing you to get more out of it even after you've used it. Use this periodically to rebuff your weapon and when you need a ranged attack.

Flame, Grant Me Strength and Blessing of the Erdtree are really reserved for Boss fights where you need a little extra. It would be a hassle to buff with them both and Golden Vow constantly, not to mention they would be a huge drain on FP, so only use them when you really need them.

 

 
ELDEN RING PALADIN BUILD (BEGINNER)
A tanky healer who can buff and defend allies, allowing them to take the brunt of blows while their teams burns things down.

Class: Confessor
Flask Spread: Mostly HP with 1 or 2 FP
Weapon: Any one-handed and a Sacred Seal
Shield: Brass Shield
Armor: The heaviest you can wear and still mid-roll
Primary Stats: Faith & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Strength
Skills: Ash of War: Barricade Shield & Ash of War: Golden Vow
Spells: Urgent Heal, Heal
Before engaging in combat you'll summon your Spirit Ashes and then buff you and them with Golden Vow to increase damage and defenses. Use Barricade Shield when facing Bosses or tough enemies to be able to tank while your summons or companions burn enemies down. 

Boosting Faith will also increase your damage and healing/buffs so prioritize this over Strength, and only use Strength to meet weapon and shield requirements.

Once you gain Heal you'll be able to heal yourself and allies around you, prolonging the life of your summons.

 
ELDEN RING TEMPLAR BUILD (LEVEL 50 PALADIN)
A tanky melee focused build that can heal itself and allies, as well as deal decent damage with Block Counters and Holy Weapon buffs.

Class: Confessor
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Noble's Slender Sword
Shield: Brass Shield
Armor: Mausoleum Knight Armor, Greathelm, Knight Greaves, & Knight Gauntlets
Primary Stats: Faith & Endurance
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Ash of War: Golden Vow, Ash of War: Sacred Blade, Ash of War: Barricade Shield
Spells: Blessing's Boon & Aspects of the Crucible: Tail
The way this Build works is that you Block Counter off of attacks into your Shield by pressing R2. This often staggers enemies allowing you a Critical Attack, dealing devastating damage, but if not the Block Counter itself does substantial damage on its own.

You'll use Barricade Shield to reduce the Stamina consumption used to Block, allowing for more Block Counters, since these consume considerable Stamina.

Golden Vow is used when Cooperating to buff your group, or your Spirit Summons if you are using a group of them. Sacred Blade is much better when playing solo, as it gives you a ranged option, and buffs your damage considerably for a short while, though it has a long wind up making it hard to use mid boss fight.

Blessing's Boon is good for Coop and solo alike as it adds to the healing over time you are already getting from the Blessed Dew Talisman, and lasts a pretty good amount of time.

Aspects of the Crucible: Tail is your AoE clear spell, and can be replaced with any other AoE when you get one, but it does substantial stagger damage as well, and can drop Trolls and other large enemies with 2 casts. Remember you can hold the cast button when using it to do 2 tail swipes.

 

 
ELDEN RING DRAGON PRIEST BUILD (BEGINNER)
A Faith-based Build that focuses dealing Fire-Damage and using Dragon Spells to maximum effect.

Class: Prophet
Flask Spread: Most FP, 1 or 2 HP
Weapon: Any
Shield: Any
Armor: Any
Primary Stats: Mind & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Faith & Arcane
Skills: None
Spells: Catch Flame and Dragonfire
The way this Build works is that you'll use Catch Flame to one shot most enemies and two or three shot tough enemies. Dragonfire is there to take out big groups of enemies, as it has a huge AoE cone that can keep dealing damage if you hold down R1. 

Spamming Catch Flame and Dragonfire absolutely wrecks enemies and Bosses but tears through your FP quickly, which is why we increase Mind to 20 first. You will also need 2 points into Arcane in order to meet the requirement for Dragonfire if you took the Prophet Class. Faith should then be increased to further boost damage, increasing Arcane as needed to meet the requirements for future Dragon Spells.

Make sure to get Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears as often as you can, and upgrade your Flasks at a Site of Grace as soon as you get them. You need the best and most Flasks you can get for this Build because of its high FP consumption.

 
ELDEN RING BLACKFLAME APOSTLE BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A Faith-Dex Build that focuses on the use of Black Flame to boost damage and give multiple options to every scenario.

Class: Prophet, Confessor or Samurai
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Any Weapon that has Bleed on it by default such as the Uchigatana, Nightrider Flail or Bloodhound's Fang & Godslayer's Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any
Primary Stats: Faith & Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Dexterity
Skills: Bloody Slash or Unsheathe work well, but you can use any you like
Spells: Black Flame, Black Flame Blade, Catch Flame and Bloodflame Blade
The way this Build works is that you'll carry your Seal in your left hand and weapon in your right, buffing it with either Black Flame Blade or Bloodflame Blade depending on the circumstance. Bloodflame Blade will boost your Bleed build up on your weapon, so if it already has Bleed on it, it will be even higher. It also boosts damage a bit.

Black Flame Blade has a very short cast time but very short duration. It does extra damage, and it's damage over time is based on the Max HP of the enemy, so it's more effective against high HP targets like Bosses and tough enemies, and is fantastic in Co Op where Bosses and enemies have even more HP. It also is good against enemies that can't Bleed.

Black Flame is your ranged spell that does solid damage, and a bit of damage over time as well based on the Max HP of the target, so just like Black Flame Blade is good against high HP enemies. However, you'll use this on many enemies just to clear some out before engaging in melee combat.

Catch Flame is great for enemies that are physical damage resistant, and is slightly cheaper than Black Flame. Use when you need fire damage up close.

 

 
ELDEN RING LIGHTNING LANCER BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A tanky Faith Build that allow for the use of offensive and defensive Incantations while playing in melee.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Treespear & Clawmark Seal/Gravel Stone Seal
Shield: Golden Greatshield or Brass Shield
Armor: Leyndell Knight Set
Primary Stats: Strength, Faith & Endurance
Secondary Stats: Dexterity & Mind
Skills: Sacred Order, Golden Vow, & Barricade Shield 
Spells: Lightning Spear, Electrify Armament, Blessing's Boon
How this Build works is that you focus on doing Block Counters with your Shield after buffing it with Barricade Shield. With this setup you will take ZERO Stamina damage when Blocking, allowing you to Block even the most deadly of attacks. This conserves Stamina for Block Counters and Attacks.

You'll use Golden Vow, Electrify Armament and Blessing's Boon to buff before tough fights, like boss encounters. Golden Vow boosts your overall damage (including spells), as well as defenses. Electrify Armament buffs your Lighting Damage on your melee attacks by a lot, and Blessing's Boon heals you over time. All 3 of these buffs last 90 seconds, which is quite long.

Lightning Spear is your ranged option for flying enemies, or instances when you just need range. It can be used effectively on horseback as well, and since you can buff with Golden Vow while on horseback you can deal even more damage while riding and casting. You actually two-hand your Seal when riding to use it, so you have even more damage since it scales with Strength.

 
ELDEN RING SWORD SAGE BUILD (LEVEL 50)
The Sword Sage is a combination of Intelligence and Faith, using the Sword of Night and Flame and Death Sorceries.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between FP & HP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame & Meteorite Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still lets you med roll
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame Stance
Spells: Rancorcall & Ancient Death Rancor
The way this Build works is that you increase your Intelligence and Faith high enough to use Sword of Night and Flame and Ancient Death Rancor, which requires 34 Int and 24 Faith.

Sword of Night and Flame has an amazing Weapon Art that allows you to do a Comet-like beam with L2 and R1 that does insane damage and has great range. L2 and R2 is a flame strike in an AoE in front of you that can wipe out packs of enemies.

Rancorcall and Ancient Death Rancor require Intelligence and Faith to use, so are a natural fit here. Meteorite Staff is not the ideal staff to use here, and you'll want to swap this out for Prince of Death's Staff once you get it, as it scales off both Int and Faith. It also boosts the damage of Death Sorceries, which both of these are.

Ancient Death Rancor does incredible stagger damage to enemies, allowing you to pin them down if you spam this, which is fantastic solo and in co op play. It's particularly good against fast moving enemies and bosses that are hard to hit with Sword of Night and Flame's Weapon arts

 

 
ELDEN RING BLACK FLAME SPELLBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Dexterity/Faith Build that uses Black Flame and Bleeding to destroy enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Cross-Naginata, Flamberge, Scythe, Reaper's Scythe, Nagakiba or Uchigatana & Godslayer's Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that allows for med roll
Primary Stats: Faith & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Mind & Vigor
Skills: Repeating Thrust, Spinning Slash, Sword Dance or Double Slash
Spells: Bloodflame Blade, Black Flame Blade, Black Flame, Scouring Black Flame & Golden Vow
The way this Build works is that you'll choose one of the weapons listed above because they come with Bleed on them natively, they call be buffed with Bloodflame Blade, and they can use the Ashes of War listed above.

You'll buff with Bloodflame Blade and Golden Vow as you make your way through Dungeons to increase your damage and Bleeding, and also your protection.

You'll use your Ash of War, whichever one you chose to help set Hemorrhage or Black Flame, depending on what you're facing. Black Flame Blade is more useful when enemies cannot Bleed, when cooperating, or when you cannot hit an enemy often enough to set Hemorrhage because they are so aggressive.

You'll use Black Flame when you need range, and Scouring Black Flame when you need AoE.

 
ELDEN RING HELLFIRE HERALD BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Dual-Wielding Greatsword Build that flattens enemies with Jump Attacks while using both Fire and Holy Damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between FP & HP
Weapon: Iron Greatsword x2
Shield: None
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers & the heaviest you can wear and still med roll 
Primary Stats: Faith & Vigor  
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Royal Knight's Resolve x2
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Blessing's Boon, Lightning Spear
The way this Build works is that you'll use two Royal Knight's Resolves on two Iron Greatswords either setting them both Flame Art or both Sacred depending on the enemies you are facing.

You'll use Jump Attacks to pancake enemies, which are further boosted by Raptor's Black Feathers, Claw Talisman and Royal Knight's Resolve. You can even buff both weapons if you have enough time for it.

Golden Vow increases your overall damage and defenses, allowing you to deal even more damage while becoming even tankier. Flame, Grant Me Strength allows you buff both your Fire and Physical Damage, and when you have two Flame Art infused Iron Greatswords that's a huge damage boost. 

Buff, Jump Attack, rinse and repeat as necessary.

 

 
ELDEN RING DEATHBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
An Intelligence/Faith Build thas uses the Sword of Night and Flame to full effect, while also using both Sorceries and Incantations to dispatch enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame, Prince of Death's Staff & Golden Order Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that allows you to med roll. Spellblade Set boosts Night and Flame's Magic attack by 2% per piece
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Magic Scorpion Charm,, Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1 & Godfrey Icon
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame Stance
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Black Flame, Loretta's Greatbow, Terra Magica, Magic Glintblade, Ancient Death Rancor
The way this Build works is that you'll prioritize using the magic attack of Sword of Night and Flame, by using things that boost its damage, as well as the damage of your regular weapon attacks. Magic Scorpion Charm, Golden Vow, Spellblade Set and Terra Magica all boost this damage, making it much more deadly. You can still use the Flame attack when you want as well, but you'll buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength instead of Terra Magica when using it to boost Fire Damage instead of magic.

You also deal incredible damage just with regular melee attacks, as the Sword of Night and Flame has one of the highest Attack Ratings in Elden Ring. If you can get someone to drop you a second one, consider dual wielding them for even more deadly melee attacks.

You'll supplement your melee attacks and weapon skills with magic, most notably Black Flame when you need some mid range Fire Damage, or Magic Glintblade when you need mid range Magic Damage. You'll use Loretta's Greatbow to take out things from really long range, and Ancient Death Rancor is there to stagger enemies and Bosses (particularly those that you can target the head), giving you an opening to use Sword of Night and Flame's Skills.

 
ELDEN RING GOLDENEYE BOW BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A purely ranged Bow Build that focuses on dealing Holy Damage and Bleed, while casting some Incantations.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Erdtree Bow, Black Bow & Finger Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any you can wear and still medium roll. Silver Tear Mask is good if you don't boost Arcane.
Talismans: Arrow's Reach Talisman, Arrow's Sting Talisman, Ritual Sword Talisman, Sacred Scorpion Charm & Green Turtle Talisman (for Bosses)
Primary Stats: Faith & Mind
Secondary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Skills: Mighty Shot & Barrage
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree, Protection of the Erdtree, Swarm of Flies & Elden Stars
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and you'll use Golden Arrows to take down targets from a distance with your Erdtree Bow using Mighty Shot. Some fights you won't be able to stay far away and that's when you'll swap to your Black Bow.

You'll use Barrage and quick shots with the Black Bow to set Hemorrhage on targets that are too hard to kill at range, or range is simply not an option using Blood Arrows. You can also pop on the Silver Tear Mask and use the Swarm of Flies spell to assist you here.

Blessing of the Erdtree is used to keep your HP at full so you gain extra damage and should be used before boss fights, or when you need to heal but aren't in immediate danger. It heals for 50% more HP per second than Blessing's Boon, which is a lot.

Protection of the Erdtree can be used before bosses that deal fire, magic, holy or lightning damage that's hard to dodge. And Elden Stars can be used in cooperative play to pressure bosses from a distance.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLASPHEMOUS BEASTMASTER BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Strength/Faith hybrid build that uses Bestial Incantations and the Blasphemous Blade to destroy enemies at range or in melee combat.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Some HP, mostly FP
Weapon: Clawmark Seal, Blasphemous Blade & Cinquedea
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows you to med roll
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Radagon's Soreseal, Green Turtle Talisman & Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Taker's Flames
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Stone of Gurranq, Beast Claw & Bestial Sling
The way this Build works is that you'll focus on using Stone of Gurranq to range down enemies when you can, using the Blasphemous Blade as back up for instances where it is just easier to melee enemies or use Taker's Flames.

You'll carry the Blasphemous Blade and Clawmark Seal in your right hand and Cinquedea in your left, two-handing the Seal when you cast spells to gain extra damage from Strength Scaling, and bonus damage to Bestial Incantations from Cinquedea.

You'll buff with Golden Vow constantly to maintain this buff whenever you are in combat, using Flame, Grant Me Strength for tougher enemies and boss fights. Beast Claw is used for AoE if you need any, and Bestial Sling can be used to take down big targets from close range if you need it.

 
ELDEN RING ELEMENTALIST BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Intelligence/Faith Build that can cast nearly any spell in the game, and only uses ranged magic to destroy enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Prince of Death's Staff & Golden Order Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Green Turtle Talisman, Marika's Soreseal, Ritual Sword Talisman, & Primal Glintstone Blade
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: None
Spells: Stone of Gurranq, Lightning Spear, Black Flame, Catch Flame, Great Glintstone Shard, Triple Rings of Light, & Golden Vow
The way this Build works is that you will use Prince of Death's Staff to cast Sorceries and Golden Order Seal to cast Incantations. You'll buff with Golden Vow to increase your spell damage, as well as boost your defenses. Then you'll select the spell that's best suited for the situation.

Stone of Guarranq is your ranged Physical Damage spell that can be chained effectively at modest range. You can also use Rock Sling, but it casts slower, though it does have longer range and does more stagger damage.

Lightning Spear is your Lightning Damage spell that you'll use to take out enemies weak to Lightning. You can charge it for extra damage as needed and it does +10% damage in the rain.

Black Flame is your ranged Fire Damage spell that deals that can be charged for extra damage, and also does a small damage over time based on the max HP of the enemy. Catch Flame is used in melee situations where enemies are so aggressive you can't cast spells. Catch Flame is cast quickly after you roll or sprint, allowing you to "melee" enemies with it.

Great Glintstone Shard is your ranged spell that has good range and average damage and can be spammed. You can use other Magic Damage spells as well like Loretta's Greatbow for more range, or you can use Comet for a more spammable higher damage Great Glintstone Shard.

Triple Rings of Light is your go to Holy Damage spell that has a modest range and good spread. Litany of  Proper Death is a great AoE that annihilates undead and prevents them from respawning.

 

 
ELDEN RING CRUSADER BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A melee/caster hybrid that focuses on Faith and Block Counters to obliterate enemies with holy or fire damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Gargoyle's Greatsword & Erdtree Seal
Shield: Brass Shield
Armor: Haligtree Knight Helm & any armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Curved Sword Talisman, Flock's Canvas Talisman, Shard of Alexander & Sacred Scorpion Charm/Fire Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Faith & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind
Skills: Barricade Shield & Sword Dance
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree, Elden Stars, Lightning Spear, Black Blade, Black Flame's Protection
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow as you travel around the game attacking enemies with Sword Dance or with Block Counters after they attack into your Brass Shield.

You'll use Barricade Shield in sections and for Bosses that it is needed for, where Blocking makes a lot of sense, and you'll unslot in sections that you don't need it, allowing you to use Sword Dance without two-handing your Gargoyle's Greatsword.

We use Gargoyle's Greatsword for this Build because it is the only Greatsword with B scaling in Faith that also allows the swapping of Ashes of War. This is crucial since you want to be able to change damage types (Fire or Holy) depending on the scenario.

You can use Elden Stars to begin Boss fights, particularly on the landscape where they are typically not aggroed until you engage them, and Lightning Spear is a good ranged option, as is Black Flame if you want a Fire option. Many spells recently got buffed so you can test them out, but you have crazy high Incantation Scaling so you'll do fantastic damage. Black Blade also works phenomenally with this Build, though you won't get it until way late in the game.

 
ELDEN RING BLASPHEMOUS HERALD BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A melee build that uses Jump Attacks and the Blasphemous Blade to demolish enemies point blank and at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Blasphemous Blade, Gargoyle's Blackblade, Gargoyle's Greatsword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers and any other Armor that allows medium rolling
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Great-Jar's Arsenal, Claw Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Taker's Flame, Corpse Wax Cutter, Flaming Strike & Sacred Order
Spells: Golden Vow , Blessing of the Erdtree, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Lightning Spear, Black Flame & Stone of Gurranq
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow as you'll use Jump Attacks to destroy enemies with Blasphemous Blade in the right hand and Gargoyle's Greatsword in the left. You'll swap the damage type of the Gargoyle's Greatsword to Flame Art with Flaming Strike, when using Blasphemous Blade. 

You'll swap to Gargoyle's Blackblade when Fire Damage is resisted to give you Holy Damage, and you'll change the Affinity on the Gargoyle's Greatsword to Sacred with the Sacred Order Ash of War. You'll swap back and forth as necessary.

Taker's Flame and Corpse Wax Cutter work nearly identically, allowing you to interchange these weapons without having to learn a new style of play. And Jump Attacks are deadly with Raptor's Black Feathers and Claw Talisman.

Clawmark Seal also allows you to cast Incantations with decent Scaling in a pinch, though you won't lean on them as you'll do way more damage with Jump Attacks and Taker's Flame/Corpse Wax Cutter.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLACKFLAME BUSHIDO BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Faith Build that uses the Cross-Naginata to to set Hemorrhage and Black Flame on enemies in melee range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Cross-Naginata or Nagakiba & Godslayer's Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask & White Reed Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Radagon's Soreseal, Godfrey Icon & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Phantom Slash, Sword Dance or Double Slash
Spells: Golden Vow, Black Flame, Bloodflame Blade, Black Flame Blade, Scouring Black Flame, Black Flame Ritual & Black Flame's Protection
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and you'll use Bloodflame Blade to help set Hemorrhage on most regular enemies, as it adds to the native bleeding of the Cross-Naginata or Nagakiba. You'll then use Phantom Slash if you're using Cross-Naginata or Sword Dance or Double Slash if you're using Nagakiba.

Phantom Slash applies Bloodflame Blade if you're buffed with it to its attacks, and what's great is that it will connect even if you get staggered during your own attack animation, allowing you to stagger enemies in many cases, and allowing you to recover and attack. You'll have to choose your openings a bit more carefully when using Sword Dance or Double Slash, but Sword Dance still has fantastic range.

Black Flame Blade is used on more difficult enemies, and since you have high Faith the damage it adds to your attacks is substantial, and this is in addition to the Black Flame damage over time it places on the enemy. 

Black Flame is great for range when you need it, and Scouring Black Flame is a good AoE that can hit multiple enemies and is good at mid range when enemies are aggressive, and Black Flame might miss. Black Flame Ritual is fantastic against aggressive or large enemies and it hits like a truck. I like to charge it for a larger radius, making it hit more effectively and increasing its damage due to Godfrey Icon. Black Flame's Protection stacks with Golden Vow and will make you very very hard to kill.

 
ELDEN RING BLACK KNIFE ASSASSIN BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Faith Build that uses dual Daggers to rapidly strike enemies and Bosses for high damage the further into combo chains you go.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Erdsteel Dagger x2, Black Knife & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Black Knife Hood, Black Knife Armor, Fire Prelate Gauntlets & Fire Prelate Greaves
Talismans: Winged Sword Insignia, Millicent's Prosthesis, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor 
Skills: Blade of Death, Bloodhound's Step & Parry
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree and Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and then you'll use your L1 combos to stun lock most enemies, building up your Attack Power because of Millicent's Prosthesis and Winged Sword Insignia. You can use Bloodhound's Step to dodge easily, or you can use Quickstep if you find it difficult to use Bloodhound's Step.

Because you have high Poise from your Armor setup, and you because you'll be using the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, you can trade damage without being interrupted quite often, and you'll have very good protection. Golden Vow also provides you with some as well, so you can finish off your combos uninterrupted.

You can use Blessing of the Erdtree and Flame, Grant Me Strength to buff healing and damage for Boss fights. And you can use Blade of Death when you need a ranged option, because melee wouldn't work or work well. Parry is used when enemies cannot be stunlocked with repeated attacks, or when you cannot swing through attacks easily.

(After patch 1.07, the duration of Blade of Death is increased. You can add Black Blade incantation to this build so you can dual stack buffs and make the build more effective.)

 

 
ELDEN RING FLAME DANCER BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Strength/Faith Build that uses the Whip: Giant's Red Braid to great effect, while also slinging Fire Spells.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Giant's Red Braid & Clawmark Seal
Shield: Any Greatshield
Armor: Any Armor that has high Poise.
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Great-Jar's Arsenal
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Flame Dance
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength, Golden Vow, Black Flame, Black Flame Ritual, Flame, Fall Upon Them
The way this Build works is that you'll be wielding a Greatshield in order to Block Counter with your Whip. Whips have very long range so you can hit enemies easily with Block Counters, and you'll have a bigger opening due to the Greatshield. Note that you won't stagger enemies on one Block Counter with a Whip, but Whips cannot deal Critical Hits anyway, so this is not so important.

Giant's Red Braid scales with Strength and Faith, making it a good candidate for a Greatshield, but also for the Clawmark Seal that increases in damage with both of these Stats. This allows you to use Incantations effectively, though not as effectively as a pure Incantation build. Still it gives you ranged options like Black Flame, which is very helpful.

Flame Dance is your AoE spell that obliterates packs of enemies and causes them to flinch on each hit. The downside is that it is easily interrupted, which is why high Poise armor is a must. Use this on tough enemies that can be flinched with each hit, or on large groups. Don't use it much on bosses, as you tend to get hit out of it before you can hit all 5x.

 Buff with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength as needed to further boost your damage.

 
ELDEN BLACK BLADE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength Faith Build that utilizes Maliketh's Black Blade and the Black Blade Incantation to optimal effects.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Maliketh's Black Blade & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Maliketh's Set or any Armor with high Poise
Talismans: Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Sacred Scorpion Charm & Claw Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Destined Death
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree & Black Blade
The Black Blade Build uses the Black Blade Incantation to open difficult fights, placing a -10% Max Health debuff on the enemy or Boss for a short time from range. This HP does not come back once this buff expires, so it's only necessary to use this once per fight, but you can use it again if you need a ranged option.

Ideally you want to use Destined Death from Maliketh's Black Blade immediately after this because Destined Death also applies a stacking -10% Max Health debuff. If both of these are applied at the same time, then the enemy or Boss loses 20% of their Max HP that doesn't come back. However, if you wait for one of these debuffs to expire before placing the other you will not get the extra 10% Max Health reduction. So time them close together for best results.

Use Golden Vow to boost your damage and defenses, and Blessing of the Erdtree to keep your HP topped off. You can add other Incantations if you want because you'll have decent Incantation Scaling with the Clawmark Seal since you prioritize Strength and Faith.

Use Jump Attacks on regular enemies, and remember that R1s and R2s with Maliketh's Black Blade have some hyper armor, allowing you to attack through other attacks most of the time.

 

 
ELDEN GOLDEN SWORD SAGE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Faith/Intelligence Build that focuses on the use of Holy Damage and Golden Order Incantations.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Coded Sword, Sword of Night and Flame, and Golden Order Seal
Shield: Blue-Gold Kite Shield
Armor: Radiant Gold Mask, and any Armor with high Poise.
Talismans: Sacred Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Ritual Shield Talisman, & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Faith & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Unblockable Blade & Barricade Shield
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree, Discus of Light, Triple Rings of Light, Radagon's Rings of Light, Elden Stars & Litany of Proper Death.
The way this Build works is that you'll be wielding the Coded Sword, which deals 100% Holy Damage and only scales with Faith. You'll use Sacred Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman and Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear to boost its damage. Use Unblockable Blade for a small cluster of enemies, or against Bosses or enemies that use Shields.

Discus of Light is your go to offensive Golden Order Incantation, and its boosted in damage by Sacred Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Holy-Shrouded Cracked Tear, Golden Order Seal and Radiant Gold Mask. You could even slot Flock's Canvas Talisman for more damage if you wish. You can chain spam this spell to deal with many enemies and Bosses from a distance.

Triple Rings of Light is used to deal with enemies that dodge when you fling spells, like Black Knife Assassins, Bloodhound Knights, or Godskin Apostles. It deals slightly more damage than Discus of Light on average, but costs about 3x the FP, so I don't advise using it regularly.

Radagon's Rings of Light is a fantastic AoE spell that can wipe out huge packs of enemies, especially if you hold down the cast button, since this further increases range. This can be used from horseback as well, and if it doesn't kill enemies, it will knock them down allowing for easy follow up casts. It has further range and damage than Wrath of Gold, and is also boosted by Golden Order Seal and Radiant Gold Mask.

Elden Stars is your super long range spell that's good at picking off enemies from a long distance, or harassing Bosses while you attack with other spells or Unblockable Blade. You won't use it often, but it's nice to have when you need it.

Litany of Proper Death you will only use against Undead enemies, so only slot this when you need it. And Golden Vow is there to increase damage and defenses further, and Blessing of the Eerdtree is there to keep your HP topped off to proc the effects of Ritual Sword and Ritual Shield Talismans.

Sword of Knight and Flame is useful against Holy Damage resistant enemies, and you should sub this in when needed. Be sure to swap out Sacred Scorpion Charm for Magic or Fire, and to replace Holy-Shrouded Cracked Tear with Magic or Fire as well. Shard of Alexander is also a nice addition here.

 
ELDEN GODSLAYER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity/Faith/Strength Build that focuses exclusively on the use of Godslayer's Greatsword.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Godslayer's Greatsword & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor with high Poise, the higher the better.
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Carian Filigreed Crest, Bull-Goat's Talisman, & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Strength & Faith
Skills: The Queen's Black Flame
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll use The Queen's Black Flame to dispatch the toughest enemies and bosses in Elden Ring, while using R1 and R2 attacks on normal enemies. You'll buff with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength as necessary to further boost damage when needed.

The Queen's Black Flame has a rather long wind up making it hard to land without trading damage, which is why you will have high Poise from your Armor (over 100) ideally, which will allow you to shrug off even the hardest hitting attacks and still keep using this Skill. Remember that the Queen's Black Flame sets the Black Flame status effect, which deals damage based on the Max HP of the target. This makes it more effective against Bosses with high HP, particularly in co op or NG+.

 

 
ELDEN SWORD SAINT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity/Faith/Strength Build that focuses on using the Sacred Relic Sword and Wave of Gold.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Sacred Relic Sword, Sword of Milos, and any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor with high Poise, the higher the better.
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Carian Filigreed Crest, Claw Talisman, & Sacred Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Faith
Secondary Stats: Strength & Vigor
Skills: Wave of Gold
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength & Any other Incantations you want.
The way this Build works is that you'll use Wave of Gold to take out packs of large enemies and on Bosses that aren't Holy Damage Resistant. We use Carian Filigreed Crest and Sword of Milos to help manage FP, so you can use Wave of Gold often and not worry about how much FP it costs.

When facing Holy Resistant enemies you'll use Jump Attacks to take them out, since Sword of Milos deals 100% Physical Damage, and Sacred Relic Sword deals about 63% Physical Damage. This will allow you to still deal great damage when attacking this way, bypassing this resistance, and the Claw Talisman only boosts this damage further. You could use the Raptor's Black Feathers for even more Jump Attack Damage if you wish.

 
ELDEN RING PYROMANCER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Faith spellcaster Build that only uses Fire Magic to burn enemies to a crisp.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Erdtree Seal & Giant's Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Light Armor so you can Light Roll
Talismans: Godfrey Icon, Fire Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman (or Canvas Flock's Talisman) & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Faith & Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: None
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Burn, O Flame!, Flame of the Fell God, Flame, Fall Upon Them & Giantsflame Take Thee
The way this Build works is that you'll use the higher Incantation Scaling of Erdtree Seal to cast your spells, while still getting the buff from Giant's Seal by holding it in your off hand. You can even swap to Giant's Seals later on when you get another from another player or in New Game Plus.

You'll use Golden Vow to buff yourself, increasing your spell damage as well as defenses, and you can use Flame, Grant Me Strength for tougher fights and Bosses. Burn, O Flame! is a Dragon killer, and is very effective against enemies you can get under, or that are very large in size, since each column can hit for very good damage.

Flame of the Fell God works well as a setup spell cast before you aggro a tough enemy or at the beginning of a Boss fight when it's closing the distance to you. If you fire off Giantsflame Take Thee immediately after casting this, they will usually detonate together for some serious burst damage. 

Giantsflame Take This is your Boss killer and is useful against tough enemies and tightly packed groups. It's expensive so don't use it all the time, just when you need it. The rest of the time use Flame, Fall Upon Them to deal with regular groups of enemies, since it's more Mana efficient and can AoE very effectively, often killing many enemies at once.

 

 
ELDEN RING DRAKE KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength/Faith Build that focuses on the use of the Magma Wyrm's Scalesword and its weapon skill Magma Guillotine.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Magma Wyrm's Scalesword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Shard of Alexander, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Carian Filigreed Crest
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Magma Guillotine
Spells: Golden Vow, & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll use Magma Guillotine on hard to kill enemies and bosses, leaping into them and dealing very high burst damage, with even more damage from the follow up attack if you can get it off.

You'll use Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength for extra damage before Boss fights begin so that you can defeat them even faster. You can add other spells to this build since you use the Clawmark Seal, but those are up to you.

 
ELDEN RING DEATH MAGE BUILD(LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A mage build that focuses on the use of Death Sorceries and the Prince of Death Staff.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split FP & HP
Weapon: Sword of Night and Flame, Golden Order Seal & Prince of Death Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll.
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Graven-Mass Talisman, Ritual Sword Talisman & Godfrey Icon or Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Night-and-Flame Stance
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Rancorcall, Ancient Death Rancor, Explosive Ghostflame. Terra Magica & Rykard's Rancor
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and then cast Rancorcall on regular trash enemies, using Explosive Ghostflame or Rykard's Rancor on groups of enemies to AoE them down quickly.

Ancient Death Rancor is great against hard to kill enemies and Bosses, especially if you charge it and are standing in Terra Magica when you cast it. It can often stagger bosses or outright kill them before they ever reach you.

Rykard's Rancor gives you a fire option that you can use Flame, Grant Me Strength to buff as well as Fire Scorpion Charm. It's good against magic resistant enemies or those weak to fire.

Sword of Night and Flame is your melee option, since Rancorcall and Ancient Death Rancor are useless at point blank range as they will fly over the target and miss.

 

 
ELDEN RING CRUCIBLE KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength/Faith Build that uses the Ordovis' Greatsword and Aspect of the Crucible Incantations.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Ordovis' Greatsword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Crucible Axe Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Godfrey Icon, Flock's Canvas Talisman, and Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Ordovis' Vortex
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Aspects of the Crucible: Tail, Aspects of the Crucible: Horns, Aspects of the Crucible: Breath
The way this Build works is that you'll use Ordovis' Vortex on Bosses and difficult enemies in order to defeat them quickly. The charged version of this weapon skill has HUGE stagger potential and usually two casts of this will drop a Boss if they aren't dead by then.

Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength are used to buff your damage with your attacks, weapon skill and Spells since they all deal physical damage or fire damage.

Apsects of the Crucible: Tail is a great AoE that can trigger Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, unlike Ordovis' Vortex, so is best used on packs of enemies to ramp up your Attack Power. Aspects of the Crucible: Horns is great on tough opponents when you are 1 on 1. It can stagger them easily, particularly when charged, and deals decent damage. It's also a great gap closer to get back in melee range. Aspects of the Crucible: Breath is great against enemies weak to fire or against enemies that can be stunlocked by it.

 
ELDEN RING KUNG FU KATARIST BUILD (ALL GAME)
The Kung Fu Katarist heavily relies on the weapon Katar, buffed with Electrify Armament to deal with lightning-imbued consecutive attacks and inflict high damage numbers. This build is designed to trade blows with enemies by having significant allocated Vigor Points. Since the Katar can do thrust damage, it can wield the Impaling Thrust Ashes of War to break enemy defenses and stances.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP & Some SP
Weapon: Katar, Erdtree Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Haligtree Knight Helm, Blackflame Monk Armor, Scaled Gauntlets, Scaled Greaves or any armor with high protection and 51+ Poise
Talismans: Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Spear Talisman, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Millicent's Prosthesis & more suggested talismans in the video.
Primary Stats: Vigor & Faith
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Impaling Thrust
Spells: Golden Vow, Electrify Armament, Bloodflame Blade, Order's Blade & Wrath of Gold
The Kung Fu Katarist is a hyper-aggressive build that deals the majority of its damage by inflicting lightning-imbued consecutive attacks on targets. Due to its tanking capability, it can receive hits and trade blows with its targets, while dishing out its attack combinations. The Katar weapon can deal with thrust damage thus it is capable of equipping the Impaling Thrust Ashes of War that can break enemy stances easily or even deal damage.

Users need to ensure to use the Electrify Armament before engaging in a fight to reach high damage potential. If the enemy is resistant to lightning attacks, on the other hand, the build is equipped with the following incantation, Bloodflame Blade and Order's Blade to be versatile in combat. In this manner, it will allow the user to use a different kind of element to buff the katar before engaging in combat.

The Golden Vow incantations provide more Attack and Defense, to support the build's playstyle. The Wrath of Gold is suggested when dealing with a large group of enemies since the Katar is most effective when dealing with a single enemy.

This build explores the following talismans, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman for more damage mitigation since the user is open for incoming damage when dealing with consecutive attacks, Spear Talisman for more damage when countering with the Katar, Millicent Prosthesis and Rotten Winged Sword Insignia further increases the build's damage per second when dealing consecutive attacks and note that both Talismans indeed stacks. More suggested Talisman alternatives were provided in the video.

 

 
ELDEN RING GLADIATOR BUILD (ALL GAME) 
Gladiator is a strength build that utilizes a cold-infused Highland Axe and a Redmane Shield. Primarily scales with strength and heavily relies on Stamp (Upward Cut) to shell out damage and takes advantage of the hyper armor that it provides that can brace incoming damage. Leading to stance breaks and critical strikes.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Highland Axe
Shield: Redmane Shield
Armor: Rotten Duelist Helm, Rotten Gravekeeper Cloak, Bull-Goats Gaunlets, Rotten Duelist Greaves
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Dagger Talisman, Bull-Goat's Talisman, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Millicent's Prosthesis, and more suggested talismans in the video
Primary Stats: Vigor, Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Endurance, Mind & Mind
Skills: Stamp (Upward Cut)
Spells: None
The Gladiator build is a straightforward but aggressive build that relies on cold-infused Highland Axe for damage. The main key point of this build is the Stamp ( Upward Cut ) Ashes of War which lets you mitigate incoming damage and allow your character to go under hyper armor. Meaning you will not be interrupted in the middle of the Ashes of War animation. You will receive mitigated damage but 90% of the time, an upward cut will connect, dealing a considerable amount of raw and stance damage. Repeat this strategy to break the stance of the enemy and dish out critical hits.

Guard Counters are at your disposal, dealing decent damage with the use of Redmane Shield. Perfect in countering heavy hits when not using Stamp (Upward Cut). The talismans suggested for this build are the Shard of Alexander for further damage increase, and Assassin's Cerulean Dagger for FP refunds since you will be spamming Stamp (Upward Cut) a lot leading to stance breaks, followed up by critical strikes hence this talisman will mitigate the FP usage. Bull-Goats Talisman to raise your Poise further. Lastly, is Millicent's Prosthesis, as you do have the option to spam R1 attacks and this talisman further boosts your overall DPS when dealing attack combinations. This talisman greatly enhances your Highland Axe capabilities as it is cold-infused. The more attacks you connect, the more frost builds up. Frost is one the best status effects in the game, not only the proc damages the enemy, but it also increases the damage received by the target. Another suggested talismans are Dragoncrest Shield for more damage mitigation as it can provide you more leeway when tackling bosses.

 
ELDEN RING GUARDIAN GOLEM BUILD (ALL GAME)
A Strength build that focuses on the use of the Golem's Halberd for devastating damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Golem's Halberd
Shield: 
Armor: Any that has at least 51 Poise
Talismans: Curved Sword Talisman, Claw Talisman, Axe Talisman, and Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Royal Knight's Resolve
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll two-hand the Golem's Halberd getting very high Attack Rating and you can use just about any attack with it effectively. You can Block Counter very easily with this Weapon since it has great Guard Boos and you have Curved Sword Talisman. You can Jump Attack easily and have Claw Talisman. And you can Charged R2 for high damage and Stance Damage and have Axe Talisman.

By wearing very heavy armor with high poise and protection, as well as stacking Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, you are able to play very aggressively with little fear of dying from hits. This allows you to trade damage with most Bosses and still come out ahead, aiming to Stagger them if you can.

Royal Knight's Resolve is quite cheap FP wise, and buffs your next attack by 80%, which allows for your Charged R2s to hit like a truck, and also your Block Counters as well. Use this as often as needed, particularly in Boss fights to make them go faster.

 

 
ELDEN RING BERSERKER BUILD (BEGINNER)
A Strength-based Bulid that focuses on deal high damage per swing and via Jump Attacks.

Class: Vagabond
Flask Spread: All HP
Weapon: Claymore and Lordsworn's Greatsword
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still med roll
Primary Stats: Endurance & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Skills: Ash of War: Quickstep
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll grab the two Greatswords as quick as you can and dual wield them from that point forward, attacking with L1 mostly or jumping and L1. Jumping with L1 is absolutely devastating and one shots most enemies, and staggers those it doesn't allowing you to roll away or Quickstep away easily.

You can use Quickstep to dodge attacks and position yourself behind or on the side of enemies easily for follow up attacks as well after landing a Jump Attack. 

Heavy Armor and high Endurance allows you good Physical protection while allowing you to still med roll, which is a must. You need to be able to roll well, even if you do have Quickstep. Eventually you can wear the heaviest armor you find and stop worrying about med roll and just use Quickstep once you get the hang of it.

 
ELDEN RING CHAMPION BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A dual-wielding Build that focuses on the use of Greatsword and Heavy Armor to tank hits while dealing devastating damage via Jump Attacks.

Class: Hero or Vagabond
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, a couple of FP
Weapon: Lordsworn's Greatsword & Claymore
Shield: None
Armor: Banished Knight Set
Primary Stats: Endurance & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Golden Vow & Determination
Spells: None
The way this build works is that you'll try to get Jump Attacks with your two Greatswords, which are boosted by the Claw Talisman. Besides this, you'll buff yourself with Golden Vow on your left weapon, and Determination on your right.

Golden Vow lasts 45 seconds when used on an Ash of War, and increases your Attack Rating by about 10%, while also improving your Resistance by 5%. This adds to your already high defenses, making you even harder to kill.

Determination is used in combat to boost the damage of both weapons, but the catch is that you need to to connect with them at the same instant or you only get the increased damage on the first hit. This is another reason we use Jump Attacks, because both weapons connect at the same time.

 

 
ELDEN RING BARBARIAN BUILD (BEGINNER)
A Strength-based Build that uses Colossus Weapons to devastating effect, by using buffed Charge Attacks.

Class: Hero
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, 1 or 2 FP
Weapon: Zweihander or other Colossus Weapon
Shield: None
Armor: Heavies you can and still med roll (high Poise ideal)
Primary Stats: Strength & Endurance
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Dexterity
Skills: Ash of War: War Cry
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use the Ash of War: War Cry to buff your damage, and to turn your Charge R2 attacks into actual "Charging" attacks, as in charging forward. These deal increased damage, and are further buffed by the Axe Talisman which increases Charge Attacks by 10%.

You'll begin fights with War Cry, then hit R2 to Charge Attack and follow up with R1 until you're out of Stamina. This should stagger or kill most enemies allowing a Critical Strike if they are still alive. R2 again as they get up if they lived and repeat backing away when you need to regain Stamina.

You'll exhaust your Stamina often so Endurance is important to allow more actions, like rolling and attacking. Additionally the Green Turtle Talisman and the Erdtree's Favor both help with Stamina management, so be sure to get them when you can.

 
ELDEN RING COLOSSAL KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A Strength focused Build that uses the Greatsword to pound enemies into the dirt using Charge Attacks.

Class: Hero or Vagabond
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Greatsword
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still med roll
Primary Stats: Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: War Cry
Spells: None
Much like the Barbarian Build we take advantage of War Cry's change to R2 attacks, allowing you to deal devastating damage. Not only is this increased via War Cry, but also through both the Axe Talisman and Roar Medallion. Both of these Talismans buff your R2, allowing you to deal substantial damage.

Learning when to use War Cry and how to use it is important because you don't have a ton of FP and you don't want to waste it needlessly. But be sure when using it to lead enemies with R2, and attack with it before they do so that you stagger them and they cannot get an attack off.

If you can chain two R2s together you will send enemies flying into the air, giving you a great opportunity to retreat and regenerate Stamina using the Green Turtle Talisman, and then return for more.

 

 
ELDEN RING ARCHER BUILD (BEGINNER)
A pure ranged Build that focuses on only archery. No melee whatsoever.

Class: Bandit
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Shortbow and Longbow
Shield: None
Armor: Light or medium weight
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Ash of War: Barrage & Ash of War: Mighty Shot
Spells: None
You'll use your Long Bow and Mighty Shot to pick off enemies at range before they close to melee range. Once close you'll use your Shortbow to evade and fire and use Barrage. Remember that you can jump away and fire in the same motion.

Having high Dexterity will allow you to increase your damage, but make sure to craft or purchase better Arrows and upgrade your Bows as often as you can. This makes a HUGE difference in damage, and might be the main reason Archer Builds fail in general. Not all Arrows are equal, choose the right ones for the situation.

Learn when to use Barrage during Boss fights, and learn how much spacing you need to get it off without taking damage.

 
ELDEN RING MAGIC ARCHER BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A bow-based build that focuses on ranged combat, but has the tools to melee in a pinch as well.

Class: Samurai, Bandit or Prisoner
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, Some FP
Weapon: Horn Bow, Misbegotten Shortbow and Lazuli Glintstone Sword x2
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can and still med roll
Primary Stats: Strength & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance and Intelligence
Skills: Rain of Arrows & Mighty Shot
Spells: None
This Build focuses primarily on the use of the Horn Bow and Magic Arrows to deal solid damage at long distances with the Mighty Shot skill. Not only does the Horn Bow deal Magic Damage natively, but it also increases the damage you deal with Magic Arrows, making them the go to choice for this Build.

You can use Rain of Arrows on your Shortbow in order to set status effects like Poison or Bleed on tough enemies, and it conserves more arrows than Barrage, but has a pretty high FP cost at 20.

Lazuli Glintstone Swords are your back up in case you need to save some arrows or if you get surrounded somehow and have decent damage and attack very quickly when dual wielded.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLAZING BUSHIDO BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Samurai Build that uses the Nagakiba and a Greatbow to take on enemies at range or in close combat.

Class: Samurai
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Nagakiba, Greatbow, Finger Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows med roll
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Blessed Dew Talisman, Arrow's Sting Talisman, Carian Filigreed Crest
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Unsheathe & Rain of Arrows
Spells: Bloodflame Blade & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll put Unsheathe on your Nagakiba and select the Quality Affinity to get B/B Scaling out of both Strength and Dexterity. The Greatbow has D/D Scaling with these so it makes sense to pump both for max damage with the Nagakiba and Greatbow. Additionally, keeping the Nagakiba only Physical Damage, will allow you to buff it with Bloodflame Blade.

You'll use Flame, Grant Me Strength to buff your Physical and Fire Damage by 20%, which applies to your Bow attacks as well as your Bloodflame Blade, which is excellent. It has short duration so you'll likely use it far more outside of combat than once it has begun.

Bloodflame Blade applies 40% of your Incantation Scaling to your Weapon as Fire Damage for 60 seconds, and also makes Bleed Build Up last a second or so after you stop swinging, allowing you to set Bleeding more easily on enemies, as their Bleed Bar doesn't deplete as quickly. It has a faster cast time, and you can pull it off in combat with some practice if you need to reapply it.

 
ELDEN RING COLOSSUS GUARDIAN BUILD (LEVEL 100)
The Colossus Guardian Build is a pure Strength Build that focuses on one-handing a single Colossus Weapon to devastating results.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Prelate's Inferno Crozier, any Sacred Seal and a Dagger
Shield: None
Armor: Lionel's Set
Talismans: Roar Medallion, Axe Talisman, Green Turtle Talisman & Lord of Blood's Exultation
Primary Stats: Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Barbaric Roar
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength & Bestial Vitality
 

The way this Build works is that you slot the Ash of War: Barbaric Roar onto the Prelate's Inferno Crozier with the Blood Affinity so that you set Hemorrhage on enemies, dealing massive damage and triggering Lord of Blood's Exultation, increasing your damage. Barbaric Roar will overwrite any weapon buff you use, so it's best to choose one with a status effect if you can, and Blood still leaves B scaling in Strength.

Using Barbaric Roar will change your R2 attack into a three hit combo that's boosted by Roar Talisman, and Axe Talisman if you hold it all the way down, though it fires off slower if you do this. However, it deals more damage and stagger damage when doing so. You use a high Poise Armor Set like Lionel's Set so that you can successfully pull off your full R2 chain without interruption.

You can buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength before tough fights and Bosses, and use Bestial Vitality to heal up small damage you might take over the course of a level or dungeon. You will take damage with this Build as you exchange blows with enemies and Bosses.

 

 
ELDEN RING SCORCHING SLAYER BUILD (LEVEL 100).
A melee focused build that uses Flames of the Redmanes to stagger enemies and bring them to their knees.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Gargoyle's Twinblade & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that can still med roll
Talismans: Winged Sword Insignia, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Fire Scorpion Charm, & Green Turtle Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind & Endurance
Skills: Flame of the Redmanes
Spells: Bloodflame Blade, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Electrify Armament
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Bloodflame Blade to increase your damage and to help set Hemorrhage on enemies. Despite the fact this weapon has no native Bleed Buildup, it can still do so somewhat effectively due to the speed at which it attacks. Additionally, when Flames of the Redmanes is cast while Bloodflame Blade is active, you will also apply this to enemies as well.

Cast Flames of the Redmanes often to stagger enemies and move in for Critical Hits in order to regain FP via Assassin's Cerulean Dagger. It usually only takes one or two casts at most, even for some bosses.

Once Bosses go down you can spam R1 attacks to proc Hemorrhage, and to deal massive damage. Flame, Grant Me Strength should be reserved for Boss fights and tough enemies. Electrify Armament is there for when Fire Damage is not called for, and you need another damage type.

 
ELDEN RING BLASPHEMOUS BEASTMASTER BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Strength/Faith hybrid build that uses Bestial Incantations and the Blasphemous Blade to destroy enemies at range or in melee combat.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Some HP, mostly FP
Weapon: Clawmark Seal, Blasphemous Blade & Cinquedea
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows you to med roll
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Radagon's Soreseal, Green Turtle Talisman & Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Taker's Flames
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Stone of Gurranq, Beast Claw & Bestial Sling
The way this Build works is that you'll focus on using Stone of Gurranq to range down enemies when you can, using the Blasphemous Blade as back up for instances where it is just easier to melee enemies or use Taker's Flames.

You'll carry the Blasphemous Blade and Clawmark Seal in your right hand and Cinquedea in your left, two-handing the Seal when you cast spells to gain extra damage from Strength Scaling, and bonus damage to Bestial Incantations from Cinquedea.

You'll buff with Golden Vow constantly to maintain this buff whenever you are in combat, using Flame, Grant Me Strength for tougher enemies and boss fights. Beast Claw is used for AoE if you need any, and Bestial Sling can be used to take down big targets from close range if you need it.

 

 
ELDEN RING COLD-BLOODED RAPTOR BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Strength/Intelligence Build that uses Claws to deal damage rapidly, and to also set the Hemorrhage and Frostbite status effects.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Bloodhound Claws, Sacrificial Axe & Academy Glintstone Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers, Haima Glintstone Crown and any other gloves and legs that allow you to med roll
Talismans: Lord of Blood's Exultation, Claw Talisman, Green Turtle Talisman & Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Strength & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Royal Knight's Resolve & Golden Vow
Spells: Great Glintstone Shard, Loretta's Greatbow, Terra Magica, Adula's Moonblade, Greatblade Phalanx
The way this Build works is that you'll two hand your Claws, which brings out a second one and buff with Royal Knight's Resolve to boost the damage with both Claws. This is possible because they are only considered one Weapon, and buffs both Claws. You'll then Jump Attack enemies or bosses for increased damage, finishing them off with R1 attacks if they survive. Keep the Sacrificial Axe in your left hand to regain 4 FP per kill, even when dual wielding your Claws.

You'll build up Hemorrhage and Frostbite on anything that doesn't die in a few hits, ripping off huge chunks of HP rapidly, making your damage output very high.

You can supplement your melee playstyle with spells to give you ranged attacks, though they will be less powerful than a pure mage Build. Still you have options depending on the situation, and Greatblade Phalanx is fantastic as it works well with a melee playstyle and helps to stagger enemies.

 
ELDEN RING SORCERY SENTINEL BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Quality Build (Strength/Dexterity) that deals solid melee damage, and can eliminate enemies at range with magic damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Watchdog's Staff & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm, Green Turtle Talisman & Claw Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Sorcery of the Crozier
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength and/or Golden Vow
The way this Build works is that you'll use Jump Attacks and regular attacks with the Watchdog's Staff to defeat enemies or break their Stance and then Critically Strike them. You'll have high Physical Strike Damage with this Build, which is one of the best damage types to have.

Additionally, you can use the weapon ability of the Watchdog's Staff to range down enemies with 100% Magic Damage. This gives you a ranged option that tracks enemies from a modest distance, and can be queued up over and over. This can allow you to defeat some enemies that are too difficult to hit with your slow swinging Watchdog's Staff. This ability doesn't scale with any Attribute, so it's difficult to raise it's damage.

Sorcery of the Crozier is also good at thinning out enemies so that you don't have to take on many at once. The bane of most slow swinging weapons is multiple enemies, and this ability gives you the tool to handle that situation.

(Patch 1.07 slightly decrease the status build up of dual wielded weapons.)

 

 
ELDEN RING VENOMOUS BLOODBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Quality Build that uses Bleed and Poison to boost Attack Power extremely high while dual wielding Curved Swords.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Scavenger's Curved Sword & Bandit's Curved Sword (if you can get a second Scavenger's Curved Sword from someone that would be better)
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask or Mushroom Crown & any that allows you to med roll
Talismans: Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia, Kindred of Rot's Exultation & Lord of Blood's Exultation
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Poisonous Mist & Seppuku
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll typically buff your left-hand weapon with Seppuku to increase its Bleed build up and damage and to trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation. Then you'll lead most fights with Poisonous Mist in order to set Poisoned to also boost your Attack Power by 30% thanks to the Mushroom Crown and Kindred of Rot's Exultation. 

You'll then swing repeatedly with L1, blending enemies down quickly to trigger both Millicent's Prosthesis and Rotten Winged Sword Insignia to further increase your Attack Power, giving you an Attack Rating of well over 1k with each Curved Sword. This allows you to attack rapidly with very high damage, with the occasional Hemorrhage proc, and while the enemy remains Poisoned.

If enemies are immune to Poisoned and Bleed, you can still trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation repeatedly with Seppuku as necessary and you can use the Raw Meat Dumpling to set Poisoned on yourself to gain Kindred of Rot's Exultation's buff.

 
ELDEN RING GRAVITY GOD BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A melee build that uses a ranged weapon ability to stagger and deal fantastic damage while remaining safely.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Fallingstar Beast Jaw & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Okina Mask, Raptor's Black Feathers, and any Armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Ritual Sword Talisman, Carian Filigreed Crest, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Gravity Bolt
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow as you travel around using Gravity Bolt at will to destroy enemies before they can even attack you once. Because Gravity Bolt staggers most enemies in one cast, even if it doesn't kill them it will often disable them preventing them from reaching you.

Gravity Bolt does mostly Physical Damage, which is great against just about every enemy type in the game, and the stagger it provides allows you to stun lock many difficult enemies and Bosses repeatedly from a safe distance.

You can also deal good Jump Attack damage with this Build because it is a Colossal Weapon and because of Raptor's Black Feathers. If you want even more Jump Attack damage you can replace Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman with Claw Talisman.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLASPHEMOUS HERALD BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A melee build that uses Jump Attacks and the Blasphemous Blade to demolish enemies point blank and at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Blasphemous Blade, Gargoyle's Blackblade, Gargoyle's Greatsword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers and any other Armor that allows medium rolling
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Great-Jar's Arsenal, Claw Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Taker's Flame, Corpse Wax Cutter, Flaming Strike & Sacred Order
Spells: Golden Vow , Blessing of the Erdtree, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Lightning Spear, Black Flame & Stone of Gurranq
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow as you'll use Jump Attacks to destroy enemies with Blasphemous Blade in the right hand and Gargoyle's Greatsword in the left. You'll swap the damage type of the Gargoyle's Greatsword to Flame Art with Flaming Strike, when using Blasphemous Blade. 

You'll swap to Gargoyle's Blackblade when Fire Damage is resisted to give you Holy Damage, and you'll change the Affinity on the Gargoyle's Greatsword to Sacred with the Sacred Order Ash of War. You'll swap back and forth as necessary.

Taker's Flame and Corpse Wax Cutter work nearly identically, allowing you to interchange these weapons without having to learn a new style of play. And Jump Attacks are deadly with Raptor's Black Feathers and Claw Talisman.

Clawmark Seal also allows you to cast Incantations with decent Scaling in a pinch, though you won't lean on them as you'll do way more damage with Jump Attacks and Taker's Flame/Corpse Wax Cutter.

 
ELDEN RING ROYAL KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Strength/Intelligence Build that uses the Royal Greatsword and Clayman's Harpoon to set Frostbite and destroy enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Royal Greatsword & Clayman's Harpoon
Shield: Eclipse Greatshield
Armor: Haima Glintstone Crown & any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Radagon's Soreseal, Great-Jar's Arsenal & Carian Filigreed Crest
Primary Stats: Strength & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Wolf's Assault & Ice Spear
Spells: Scholar's Shield (optional)
The way this Build works is that you'll swap between using the Royal Greatsword and Clayman's Harpoon depending on the circumstances, while Blocking with your Eclipse Greatshield and using Guard Counters for massive damage and Critical Attacks.

Wolf's Assault does devastating damage if you can land the first hit, and the AoE will often one shot groups of enemies, and both of these hits build up Frostbite, though the normal weapon attacks of the Royal Greatsword do not.

You can swap to the Clayman's Harpoon, using the Cold version for better Strength scaling, and to help set the Frostbite status effect more easily. You'll use Ice Spear with it to range enemies when needed, using to Stance Break enemies by filling their stagger meter now and then.

You can buff with Scholar's Shield if you want to equip a staff, which further boosts the Guard Boost and damage negation of your Shield, making you damn near invincible while Blocking. Keep in mind you can use Clayman's Harpoon to Block and attack at the same time, so it's a good strategy against enemies you are having a hard time with.

 

 
ELDEN RING COLOSSAL CRUSHER BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A pure Strength based Build that uses a giant hammer to pummel enemies into the ground.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Giant-Crusher & Highland Axe
Shield: None
Armor: Bull-Goat Set or other high Poise Armor
Talismans: Roar Medallion, Shard of Alexander, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Assassin's Crimson Dagger
Primary Stats: Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Troll's Roar
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll run around using the Troll's Roar Ash of War to stagger enemies and then follow up with a Critical Attack finishing them off in a matter of seconds. Troll's Roar has a rather long cast time, making it challenging to pull off most of the time, except that you will have high Poise Armor so you will be able to pull this off even if hit.

Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, and Assassin's Crimson Dagger will replenish the cost of Troll's Roar, and replenish any HP you are missing if you get hit while casting it. Colossal Weapons trigger both of these Talismans twice when doing a Critical Attack, making them twice as effective.

When facing Bosses I highly recommend swapping out these two Talismans for Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman and Green Turtle Talisman because you won't be doing as many Critical Strikes. This will give you more protection and more Stamina Recovery, which are needed in longer fights. Remember to use the follow up attack when using Troll's Roar to deal even more damage, and to stagger enemies that don't stagger from the roar itself.

 
ELDEN RING BLOODY BOWMAN BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Strength Build that uses the Black Bow to unleash a Barrage of Blood and Poison Arrows at enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Black Bow
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask, any Light Armor
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Arrow's Sting Talisman, Spear Talisman (or Lord of Blood's Exultation)
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor 
Skills: Barrage
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use the Black Bow to range down enemies. Based on what enemies you are facing, you'll use regular Arrows for trash enemies, or enemies that you won't get much out of triggering Hemorrhage or Poison on because they'll be dead too quickly. Stock up on these, as you can purchase about 700 of them for 7k Runes or so.

You'll use Serpent Arrows and Bloodbone Arrows (Fletched) to deal with tough enemies and Bosses. Using the Barrage ability of Black Bow will allows you to set these Statuses very easily through rapid attacks, but will also deal decent damage in their own right.

Save the Bloodbone Arrows for Bosses because of the three types they are the only ones that are crafted, making them a bit more difficult to get, though it's not incredibly hard at this stage. Note that making the Fletched version is ideal, because it increases the Range of these Arrows. When arrows lands outside of their range they deal reduced damage, so having better Range keeps your damage higher.

 

 
ELDEN RING FLAME DANCER BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Strength/Faith Build that uses the Whip: Giant's Red Braid to great effect, while also slinging Fire Spells.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Giant's Red Braid & Clawmark Seal
Shield: Any Greatshield
Armor: Any Armor that has high Poise.
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Great-Jar's Arsenal
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Flame Dance
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength, Golden Vow, Black Flame, Black Flame Ritual, Flame, Fall Upon Them
The way this Build works is that you'll be wielding a Greatshield in order to Block Counter with your Whip. Whips have very long range so you can hit enemies easily with Block Counters, and you'll have a bigger opening due to the Greatshield. Note that you won't stagger enemies on one Block Counter with a Whip, but Whips cannot deal Critical Hits anyway, so this is not so important.

Giant's Red Braid scales with Strength and Faith, making it a good candidate for a Greatshield, but also for the Clawmark Seal that increases in damage with both of these Stats. This allows you to use Incantations effectively, though not as effectively as a pure Incantation build. Still it gives you ranged options like Black Flame, which is very helpful.

Flame Dance is your AoE spell that obliterates packs of enemies and causes them to flinch on each hit. The downside is that it is easily interrupted, which is why high Poise armor is a must. Use this on tough enemies that can be flinched with each hit, or on large groups. Don't use it much on bosses, as you tend to get hit out of it before you can hit all 5x.

Buff with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength as needed to further boost your damage.

 
ELDEN RING INQUISITOR BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that focuses on the use of the Ghiza's Wheel Colossal Weapon for optimal damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Ghiza's Wheel
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still medium roll
Talismans: Axe Talisman, Lord of Blood's Exultation, Claw Talisman & Millicent's Prosthesis
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Vigor
Skills: Contagious Fury
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use the one-handed R2 and one-handed charged R2 attacks of Ghiza's Wheel to take advantage of Axe Talisman, and to give you hyper armor, but most importantly to hit multiple times as the wheel spins when it lands. If you two-hand this weapon then it spins behind you instead of in front of you, so it's important to one-hand it and use these R2 attacks, because R1s don't make the wheel spin.

Spinning Wheel does not trigger Hemorrhage easily, and does not trigger Winged Sword Insignia or Millicent's Prosthesis, so it's not particularly useful for tough enemies so we don't use it often. Instead you'll use Jump Attack, buff with Contagious Fury to further boost your R2 damage, and use Charged R2s for even more damage and stagger.

When the wheel spins after an R2 or charged R2, you'll often trigger Hemorrhage in one attack, which will trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation and White Mask if you're using it. This boosts your Attack Power even higher, and you'll often trigger Millicent's Prosthesis at the same time, getting even higher attack rating.

 

 
ELDEN BLACK BLADE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength Faith Build that utilizes Maliketh's Black Blade and the Black Blade Incantation to optimal effects.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Maliketh's Black Blade & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Maliketh's Set or any Armor with high Poise
Talismans: Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Sacred Scorpion Charm & Claw Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Destined Death
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree & Black Blade
The Black Blade Build uses the Black Blade Incantation to open difficult fights, placing a -10% Max Health debuff on the enemy or Boss for a short time from range. This HP does not come back once this buff expires, so it's only necessary to use this once per fight, but you can use it again if you need a ranged option.

Ideally you want to use Destined Death from Maliketh's Black Blade immediately after this because Destined Death also applies a stacking -10% Max Health debuff. If both of these are applied at the same time, then the enemy or Boss loses 20% of their Max HP that doesn't come back. However, if you wait for one of these debuffs to expire before placing the other you will not get the extra 10% Max Health reduction. So time them close together for best results.

Use Golden Vow to boost your damage and defenses, and Blessing of the Erdtree to keep your HP topped off. You can add other Incantations if you want because you'll have decent Incantation Scaling with the Clawmark Seal since you prioritize Strength and Faith.

Use Jump Attacks on regular enemies, and remember that R1s and R2s with Maliketh's Black Blade have some hyper armor, allowing you to attack through other attacks most of the time.

 
ELDEN CARIAN CAVALIER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that uses a halberd to devastating results on horseback and on foot.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Loretta's War Sickle & any Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Royal Knight Set or any with high Poise
Talismans: Bull-Goat's Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia or Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Loretta's Slash
Spells: Freezing Mist
The way this Build works is that you'll use the very fast attacks of Loretta's War Sickle to melt enemies in one or two attacks, and Bosses in less than a minute. When you combine the fast attacks of the War Sickle with high Poise and Talismans like Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis you get very high DPS.

Casting Freezing Mist on a Boss first will debuff them and increase the damage you do to them before beginning your assault. I usually cast this an then try to keep them in the mist until Frostbite triggers and then go to town.

Halberds are exceptional on horseback because of their hitboxes and attack speed, so learn to fight from horseback when you can, and consider adding the Lance Talisman when doing so for even more damage.

Loretta's Slash is very situational, and this build is not setup to optimize its damage. However, it's great against enemies that hit hard since they can't stagger you out of it, allowing you to connect for damage 99% of the time. Trading damage is fine with this build since you have high protection.

 

 
ELDEN GODSLAYER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity/Faith/Strength Build that focuses exclusively on the use of Godslayer's Greatsword.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Godslayer's Greatsword & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor with high Poise, the higher the better.
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Carian Filigreed Crest, Bull-Goat's Talisman, & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Strength & Faith
Skills: The Queen's Black Flame
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll use The Queen's Black Flame to dispatch the toughest enemies and bosses in Elden Ring, while using R1 and R2 attacks on normal enemies. You'll buff with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength as necessary to further boost damage when needed.

The Queen's Black Flame has a rather long wind up making it hard to land without trading damage, which is why you will have high Poise from your Armor (over 100) ideally, which will allow you to shrug off even the hardest hitting attacks and still keep using this Skill. Remember that the Queen's Black Flame sets the Black Flame status effect, which deals damage based on the Max HP of the target. This makes it more effective against Bosses with high HP, particularly in co op or NG+.

 
ELDEN RING STARSCOURGE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength Build that uses the Starscourge Greatsword and its devastating weapon skill: Starcaller Cry.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Starscourge Greatsword & Sacrificial Axe
Shield: None
Armor: General Radahn Set
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Shard of Alexander, Great-Jar's Arsenal & Millicent's Prosthesis
Primary Stats: Strength & Endurance
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Starcaller Cry
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use Sacrificial Axe in your offhand and Starscourge Greatsword in your right. When you dual wield the Starscourge Greatsword, since it's a paired weapon, you will still technically have the Axe equipped, which will provide you 4 FP every time you kill an enemy. This allows you to use Starcaller Cry more liberally, which is great.

Starcaller Cry should be used on large groups of enemies since it has a huge AoE radius, and can often one shot weaker enemies. Make sure you use the follow up attack to finish off tougher to kill enemies, since it does far more damage than the cry itself.

Jump Attacks can be used on lone enemies or on Bosses that you struggle to perform Starcaller Cry against. Remember to start the cry when bosses are just on the edge of the AoE to give you time to pull off the follow up attack without being interrupted. Your armor does have good Poise, but some bosses hit really hard.

 

 
ELDEN RING DRAKE KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength/Faith Build that focuses on the use of the Magma Wyrm's Scalesword and its weapon skill Magma Guillotine.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Magma Wyrm's Scalesword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Shard of Alexander, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Carian Filigreed Crest
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Magma Guillotine
Spells: Golden Vow, & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll use Magma Guillotine on hard to kill enemies and bosses, leaping into them and dealing very high burst damage, with even more damage from the follow up attack if you can get it off.

You'll use Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength for extra damage before Boss fights begin so that you can defeat them even faster. You can add other spells to this build since you use the Clawmark Seal, but those are up to you.

 
ELDEN RING BLACK ARROW BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Bow Build that focuses on the use of the Black Bow to take down enemies and bosses at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, few FP
Weapon: Black Bow & any Seal that weighs nothing
Shield: None
Armor: Little or no Armor
Talismans: Old Lord's Talisman, Arrow's Sting Talisman, Shard of Alexander (or Ritual Sword Talisman) & Blue Dancer Charm
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Faith
Skills: Barrage
Spells: Golden Vow, and Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and use Barrage against hard to kill enemies, otherwise you'll jump shoot and land shoot enemies or roll shoot them with your Bow, since Black Bow operates like a Shortbow, allowing you to do this.

Flame, Grant Me Strength is useful when you need even more damage. You do 100% physical damage with this build, so this really helps out, and the Old Lord's Talisman helps extend the duration so you don't have to rebuff so quickly.

Blue Dancer Charm gives you a decent amount of damage with this build as long as you can keep your equip load low.

 

 
ELDEN RING ELDEN LORD BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that uses Axe of Godfrey and its weapon skill Regal Roar to pancake foes.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Axe of Godfrey & Highland Axe
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Roar Medallion, Shard of Alexander, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Axe Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Regal Roar
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use Regal Roar on a tough enemy or group of enemies in order to knock them into the air, dealing substantial damage while also changing your R2 and charged R2 attacks and buffing your damage. Roar Medallion and Highland Axe both buff your Roar and follow up attack damage.

You'll then proceed to attack with R2s and charged R2s to pound enemies to death quickly, trading damage as necessary, since you'll win every trade. You can rebuff with Regal Roar as necessary, making sure to use it when bosses are just walking into the edge of it, which should give you time to cast it and follow up with R2 without getting hit more than once, so you aren't staggered.

 
ELDEN RING DRAGONSCALE DAIMYO BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A melee build that focuses on the use of Dragonscale Blade and its weapon skill: Ice Lightning Sword.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Dragonscale Blade & Uchigatana
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll.
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Shard of Alexander & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Ice Lightning Sword & Flaming Strike
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll buff your Fire Uchigatana with Flaming Strike and then use Ice Lightning Sword on an enemy or boss in order to deal some damage while also adding Lightning Damage to your Dragonscale Blade, as well as adding Frostbite build up to its attacks. This will allow you very high damage with repeated strikes while dual wielding.

Or you can use the Jellyfish Shield in your left hand instead of the Fire Uchigatana, which will allow you to use Ice Lightning Sword while two-handing, buffing your weapon, and then swapping to one hand and using Contagious Fury on the Shield to get even more damage. You can reach over 900 Attack Power this way, which is deadly.

 

 
ELDEN RING CRUCIBLE KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength/Faith Build that uses the Ordovis' Greatsword and Aspect of the Crucible Incantations.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Ordovis' Greatsword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Crucible Axe Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Godfrey Icon, Flock's Canvas Talisman, and Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Ordovis' Vortex
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Aspects of the Crucible: Tail, Aspects of the Crucible: Horns, Aspects of the Crucible: Breath
The way this Build works is that you'll use Ordovis' Vortex on Bosses and difficult enemies in order to defeat them quickly. The charged version of this weapon skill has HUGE stagger potential and usually two casts of this will drop a Boss if they aren't dead by then.

Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength are used to buff your damage with your attacks, weapon skill and Spells since they all deal physical damage or fire damage.

Apsects of the Crucible: Tail is a great AoE that can trigger Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, unlike Ordovis' Vortex, so is best used on packs of enemies to ramp up your Attack Power. Aspects of the Crucible: Horns is great on tough opponents when you are 1 on 1. It can stagger them easily, particularly when charged, and deals decent damage. It's also a great gap closer to get back in melee range. Aspects of the Crucible: Breath is great against enemies weak to fire or against enemies that can be stunlocked by it.

 
ELDEN RING GRIM REAPER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength/Arcane build that uses a Reaper and the Stormcaller Ash of War to shred enemies in seconds.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP
Weapon: Grave Scythe & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask and and the heaviest Armor that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Lord of Blood's Exultation and Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Arcane & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Stormcaller
Spells: Bloodflame Blade, Poison Armament, Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Poison Mist and Swarm of Flies
The way this Build works is that you'll buff your Scythe with Bloodflame Blade and use Stormcaller to rapidly strike enemies or Bosses for high damage and decent Bleed Build Up. The Grave Scythe has native Bleed Build Up on hit, and when combined with Bloodflame Blade, this only becomes more effective.

Stormcaller allows you to hit many many times in rapid succession, charging up your Rotten Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis talismans, while also triggering White Mask and Lord of Blood's Exultation. This results in insane Attack Power, particularly when buffed with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength, where you can reach over 2500!

Poison Armament and Poison Mist are useful against Bleed Immune enemies, providing you an option in these cases. You can also use Mushroom Crown and Kindred of Rot's Exultation in these cases to keep your Attack Power high.

 

 
ELDEN RING PERFECT PALADIN BUILD (ALL LEVELS)
A Strength/Faith Build that focuses on the use of Block Counters and buffs to slash enemies to pieces.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Miquellan Knight's Sword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: Haligtree Crest Greatshield
Armor: Haligtree Knight Set and Greathelm
Talismans: Bull-Goat's Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Curved Sword Talisman & Sacred Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Sacred Blade
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Blessing of the Erdtree
The way this Build works is that you'll use Golden Vow to buff your defense and damage, and then use your Greatshield to Block enemy attacks, following up with a Block Counter when necessary, staggering enemies and often giving you a free attack if you don't kill them outright.

Sacred Blade is exceptional since patch 1.07 and using it point blank will both deal damage with the weapon and the holy wave, making it deadly up close. It also buffs your weapon for more damage and for longer, allowing you to get more out of it even after you've used it. Use this periodically to rebuff your weapon and when you need a ranged attack.

Flame, Grant Me Strength and Blessing of the Erdtree are really reserved for Boss fights where you need a little extra. It would be a hassle to buff with them both and Golden Vow constantly, not to mention they would be a huge drain on FP, so only use them when you really need them.

 
ELDEN RING BLAZING EXECUTIONER BUILD (ALL LEVELS)
A Strength Build that focuses on the use of the Crescent Moon Axe and the Flaming Strike Ash of War.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Crescent Moon Axe
Shield: None
Armor: Raging Wolf Set & Blaidd's Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Claw Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, & Axe Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Flaming Strike
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use Flaming Strike to buff your Fire Crescent Moon Axe and than use the R2 and Charged R2 attacks to sweep multiple enemies, and Jump Attacks to take on single enemies. R1 spam can be used on hard to kill enemies to keep them staggered as well.

Flaming Strike is exceptional in this build because it will increase your already high damage, but will deal Fire Damage and allow for a follow up attack that deals decent damage. Don't forget that you can just use Flaming Strike without the follow up for easy to kill enemies to save on FP.

 

 
ELDEN RING HAIMA HOPLITE BUILD (ALL GAME)
Haima Hoplite is based on Strength and Intelligence stat attributes to utilize the Clayman's Harpoon's Physical and Magic damage. Paired with the Impaling Thrust and Repeating Thrust Ashes of War, this build can stance-break targets or even burst down bosses with highly damaging repeating thrusts.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Clayman's Harpoon, Academy Glintstone Staff
Shield: Cuckoo Greatshield
Armor: Cuckoo Knight Helm, Blaidd's Armor, Cuckoo Knight Gauntlets, Cuckoo Knight Greaves or any armor with high protection and 51+ Poise
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Curved Sword Talisman, Spear Talisman, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia & more suggested talismans in the video.
Primary Stats: Vigor, Strength & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Repeating Thrust, Impaling Thrust
Spells: Terra Magica, Scholar's Armament
The Haima Hoplite build is a Strength and Intelligence build that relies on a Clayman's Harpoon to deal damage to targets. Its uncommon weapon damage type which can deal with physical and magic damage simultaneously opens up interesting setups such as utilizing Scholar's Armaments for more damage. The Ashes of War for this build is the Repeating Thrust, which can deal high DPS to any target in conjunction with Scholar's Armament. While the Impaling Thrust Ashes of War can break the enemy's stance easily and deal even more damage when doing critical strikes.

The main focus of this build is the Clayman's Harpoon. As mentioned, the user will rely on its physical and magic damage when dealing damage to targets. Using the Academy Glintstone Staff will let the user buff the Clayman Harpoon's Magic Damage by imbuing the weapon with Scholar's Armament. In this manner, Clayman Harpoon's repeating thrust can easily score high damage numbers due to added damage from the Scholar Armament.

When fighting bosses, it is suggested to switch to Impaling Thrust Ashes of War to quickly break the target's stance and be open from Critical Strikes. This Ashes of War also can help the Clayman Harpoon Penetrate shielded enemies with ease. Experiment with both Ashes of War to gain the best results, depending on the type of targets that the user will encounter.

This build explores the following talismans, Shard of Alexander for further damage increase overall, Curved Sword Talisman to increase the guard counter damage of this build since it is an option to take advantage of Guard Counters with this build, Spear Talisman for more Spear counter damage, especially this build tank enemy hits and then counter it spear strikes, and lastly, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia for more damage output especially when using the Repeating Thrust. More suggested Talisman alternatives were provided in the video.

On the other hand, since the user is provided with a shield, guard counters are a suggested strategy when dealing with regular enemies. This build is tanky enough to trade blows so use the Repeating Thrust often to take advantage of the Spear Talisman's added counter damage.

 
ELDEN RING COLDSTORM CLERIC BUILD (ALL GAME)
Coldstorm Cleric is a build that makes use of a Flail, such as a Chainlink Flail, and its high damage. This is paired with the Stormcaller Ash of War to increase Bloodloss build-up as well as Frostbite once you use the Cold infusion maximizing damage output and the chance to stagger opponents.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Chainlink Flail
Shield: Cuckoo Greatshield or any Greatshield
Armor: Marais Mask, Noble's Traveling Garb, Scaled Gauntlets, Scaled Greaves
Talismans: Bull-goat's Talisman, Warrior Jar Shard or Shard of Alexander, Millicent's Prosthesis, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Curved Sword Talisman, Dagger Talisman, Ritual Sword Talisman, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger
Primary Stats: Vigor, and Strength
Secondary Stats: Mind, Endurance, and Faith
Skills: Stormcaller
Seal: Clawmark Seal or any Seal
Spells: Fire's Deadly Sin
Great Runes: Godrick's Great Rune, Radahn's Great Rune
Coldstorm Cleric is a build that makes use of a Flail, such as a Chainlink Flail, and its high damage and Strength scaling. This is paired with the Stormcaller Ash of War to increase Bloodloss build-up, maximizing damage output and the chance to stagger opponents. This build does heavy damage to targets, but it also builds up Frostbite once you add the cold infusion, and blood loss maximizing your damage output.

This build is also paired with the Fire's Deadly Sin Incantation, to continuously retrigger the Frostbite Status Effect since it is a continuous source of fire damage it can reliably reset the Frostbite status effect on enemies for build that inflicts frostbite rapidly.

This build explores the following talismans, the Warrior Jar Shard or Shard of Alexander to increase Stormcaller damage, other Talismans you can consider have also been added to the list, 

Overall, this build utilizes each equipment piece to increase damage output enhance to reusability of the Stormcaller skill, and continuously cause a Status Effect build-up on opponents to further maximize their damage intake. Other equipment pieces you can carry should typically increase the damage of your build. When finally implementing this build, wait for an opening before finally mashing L2 to trigger the Stormcaller skill, getting in a number of hits that would build Frostbite, Hemorrhage, and build your attack power which could work all together to stagger your opponent and give you a chance to continuously repeat the process and melt away opponent HP. 

 

 
ELDEN RING SCARLET SPEAR BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity Build that focuses on the use of dual spears and the Scarlet Rot and Poison status effects.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: All HP
Weapon: Rotten Crystal Spear x2
Shield: Coil Shield
Armor: Redmane Knight Set or any armor with high protection and 51+ Poise
Talismans: Kindred of Rot's Exultation, Winged Sword Insignia, Millicent's Prosthesis & Spear Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Charge Forth & Viper Bite
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use dual wield two Rotten Crystal Spears to not only apply Scarlet Rot, but also build up your Attack Power quickly via very fast L1 attacks thanks to the Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis. Dual Spear attacks are some of the fastest in Elden Ring, and they attack faster than many R1 attacks of other weapons.

Additionally, Spears deal Thrust Damage which deals increased damage to enemies in the forward motion of their attack (called Counter Damage). This allows you to shell out some incredible damage when your Attack Power is buffed if you can trade blows with Bosses, particularly because we have the Spear Talisman slotted which further increases this damage.

Coil Shield can trigger Deadly Poison (a stronger form of Poison) on Bosses easily with one use, or two at most, triggering your Kindred of Rot's Exultation at the beginning of the fight, allowing you to have buffed Attack Power from the very beginning all while the Boss takes damage over time. 

 
ELDEN RING FROST PALADIN BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A quality build that uses the Zamor Curved Sword to deal both Physical and Magic Damage, as well as trigger Frostbite on enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Zamor Curved Sword & Clawmark Seal
Shield: Kite Shield or any Shield
Armor: Fingerprint Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Magic Scorpion Charm, Curved Sword Talisman & Assassin's Cerulean Dagger
Primary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Secondary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Skills: Zamor Ice Storm
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing's Boon, Heal & any other buffs you like
The way this Build works is that you'll use the Zamor Curved Sword and its weapon skill Zamor Ice Storm to devastating effect. Zamor Ice Storm deals exclusively Magic Damage and sets Frostbite, despite the weapon having no Magic Damage itself, nor any Intelligence scaling. However, it deals very high damage, particularly when boosted by Shard of Alexander and Magic Scorpion Charm.

Because you don't need to focus on your damaging stats (STR and DEX) as much, because they don't boost the damage of Zamor Ice Storm, this allows you to drop points into Faith to pick up other buffs like Golden Vow, which will further boosts you Zamor Ice Storm damage, which is great.

You can also do Block Counter relatively well with this Build due to the Curved Sword Talisman, and because you have Assassin's Cerulean Dagger slotted you can refund FP when you Critical Strike after a Block Counter, allowing you to use Zamor Ice Storm more easily.

 

 
ELDEN RING SUPREME SAMURAI BUILD (ALL GAME)
A pure DEX Build that uses the Nagakiba and Grease to have the best damage for any situation, coupled with extremely high mobility.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Nagakiba
Shield: None
Armor: Nox Swordstress Armor, White Reed Gauntlets, Ronin's Greaves, Iron Kasa
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, " target="">Great-Jars Arsenal, & Bull-Goat's Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Unsheathe
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll focus on using Unsheathe during difficult encounters or during 1v1 type situations. The R1 attack is much faster than the R2, but deals less Stance damage and is ideal for situations where you don't know what the enemy is going to do, since it comes out faster than the R2 attack.

The R2 attack is used to deal more damage when you can predict the attack, but also when you are trying to Stance-break an enemy or boss. Repeated attacks with the R2 can Stance-break most Bosses in 3 hits, not unlike Moonveil, allowing you to get free attacks or a Critical Attack.

You can use different Greases depending on the boss or enemy you are facing. For example, Blood Grease works exceptionally well since the weapon already has native bleed build up on it, allowing you to trigger Hemorrhage much more easily. Make sure to craft and use Greases on harder to defeat enemies and bosses.

 
ELDEN RING BLOODHOUND BUILD (ALL LEVELS)
A Dexterity Build that focuses on the use of the Bloodhound's Fang and its weapon skill Bloodhound's Finesse.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Bloodhound's Fang
Shield: None
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers & any armor that adds up to 51 Poise with the Bull-Goat's Talisman equipped
Talismans: Bull-Goat's Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Claw Talisman and Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Strength
Skills: Bloodhound's Finesse
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use Bloodhound's Fang from almost the beginning the game, essentially after you defeat Bloodhound Knight Darriwil, which should be first thing. You should two-hand it and lean into its weapon skill: Bloodhound's Finesse as much as possible.

Bloodhound's Finesse gives you some i-frames during its initial attack animation, and some again when you dash forward and strike if you use the follow up attack. Practice using this ability early on in the game so that you learn these timings, and this will help you use this skill later on without getting hit while simultaneously dealing damage.

Utilize jump attacks with this build when you can as well since the Bloodhound's Fang has a higher Jump Attack Damage multiplier than other Curved Greatswords and also because you'll be wearing Raptor's Black Feathers and Claw Talisman, both further boost Jump Attack Damage. This gets even better in Journey 2 if you get a second Bloodhound's Fang!

Try not to focus on the Bleed Build Up of this weapon, since enemies will usually die before it triggers 9 out of 10 times, but you might be well off to use Blood Grease during Boss fights or other Greases to further boost your damage, so make sure to do this!

 

 
ELDEN RING SAMURAI BUILD (BEGINNER)
A mix of ranged and melee combat, as well as mounted that makes you feel like a proper Samurai while playing Elden Ring, and is wickedly effective.

Class: Samurai
Flask Spread: Mostly HP and 1 or 2 FP
Weapon: Uchigatana and Longbow
Shield: None
Armor: Land of Reeds Set
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Mind
Skills: Ash of War: Unsheathe & Ash of War: Mighty Shot
Spells: None
This Build plays just like a Samurai by picking off targets with your Long Bow, using Mighty Shot to deal increased damage when needed. Swapping to Uchigatana when enemies close the distance to you, using Unsheathe to deal incredible damage. Unsheathe is not only fast, it deals high damage, and gap closes all in one rapid motion for minimal FP cost. Learn to roll back and then use Unsheathe in one movement.

 
ELDEN RING MOONVEIL SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A melee-mage Build that uses Transient Moonlight to stagger enemies and deal critical damage.

Class: Prisoner or Samurai
Flask Spread: Slightly more HP than FP
Weapon: Moonveil
Shield: None
Armor: Land of Reeds Set
Primary Stats: Intelligence &Vigor
Secondary Stats: Dexterity
Skills: Transient Moonlight
Spells: Loretta's Greatbow, Glintstone Pebble and Carian Greatsword
The way this Build works is that you use Transient Moonlight with R2 instead of R1 to stagger enemies and then critically strike them. Using the Assassin's Cerulean Dagger and Carian Filigreed Crest recovers the cost of using Transient Moonlight so that you never run out of FP.

Use Loretta's Greatbow to take out difficult enemies at range, and use Glintstone Pebble to do the same when they aren't quite as far away.

Carian Greatsword is used to AoE enemies that are grouped up, and is benefited by Radagon Icon.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLOODBLADE BUILD (BEGINNER)
A Bleed-focused Build that uses the Bleed Status Effect to continuously rip off huge chunks of enemy health via dual blades.

Class: Warrior
Flask Spread: All HP
Weapon: Scimitar x2
Shield: Any that can Parry
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still Med Roll
Primary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Secondary Stats: Dexterity & Arcane
Skills: Ash of War: Bloody Slash x2
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you slot the Ash of War: Bloody Slash on to both Scimitars so that when you strike with both weapons via L1 you build up Bleed faster. To do this you will need a Lost Ashes of War and you'll need to Duplicate it at Blacksmith Hewg.

Focus on using running and jumping L1 attacks as these do 4 hits very quickly, as opposed to just L1 by itself which does 2 or rolling L1 which does 3. 

Keep in mind enemy Bleed bars are not visible, but they drain just like players, meaning you must strike repeatedly and often or you won't rip off chunks of HP via Bleed. Enemies also seem to have increased resistance with each subsequent Bleed, so it will take more and more strikes the more you set this Status.

Play aggressively, but make sure not to get yourself killed going for the Bleed proc. Wear the heaviest Armor you can and still mid roll, so that if you do get hit, it deals the least amount of damage possible.

Use Bloody Slash when necessary, but it's situational. It's long cast time makes it hard to use, even if it's damage is incredibly high.

 
ELDEN RING BUILD: BLAZING BUSHIDO BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Samurai Build that uses the Nagakiba and a Greatbow to take on enemies at range or in close combat.

Class: Samurai
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Nagakiba, Greatbow, Finger Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any that still allows med roll
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Unsheathe & Rain of Arrows
Spells: Bloodflame Blade & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll put Unsheathe on your Nagakiba and select the Quality Affinity to get B/B Scaling out of both Strength and Dexterity. The Greatbow has D/D Scaling with these so it makes sense to pump both for max damage with the Nagakiba and Greatbow. Additionally, keeping the Nagakiba only Physical Damage, will allow you to buff it with Bloodflame Blade.

You'll use Flame, Grant Me Strength to buff your Physical and Fire Damage by 20%, which applies to your Bow attacks as well as your Bloodflame Blade, which is excellent. It has short duration so you'll likely use it far more outside of combat than once it has begun.

Bloodflame Blade applies 40% of your Incantation Scaling to your Weapon as Fire Damage for 60 seconds, and also makes Bleed Build Up last a second or so after you stop swinging, allowing you to set Bleeding more easily on enemies, as their Bleed Bar doesn't deplete as quickly. It has a faster cast time, and you can pull it off in combat with some practice if you need to reapply it.

 

 
ELDEN RING THUNDERING SWORDSPEAR BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A melee focused build that uses Lighting to strike enemies at range, and to boost damage in melee.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Guardian's Swordspear & Finger Seal
Shield: Banished Knight's Shield or Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Great Helm, Tree Coat, Chain Gloves, Chain Greaves
Talismans: Lightning Scorpion Charm, Radagon's Soreseal, Green Turtle Talisman & Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1
Primary Stats: Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Thunderbolt
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Electrify Armament, and Blessing's Boon
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow as you make your way around the game, one shotting most easy enemies with Thunderbolt from range, or even tough enemies as necessary. Thunderbolt scales off of base weapon damage and Dexterity scaling, and this is why we chose the Guardian's Swordspear. It has very high base damage and A scaling in Dexterity, and doesn't require much Strength investment.

You can dispatch any in melee if they approach you due to your high Attack Rating, and you can Block with your Shield as necessary. I do advise against Block Countering with this Weapon though as it is slow and will likely get you hit.

Cast Flame, Grant Me Strength when you need extra damage like in a Boss fight or before a tough enemy, and the same with Electrify Armament. Both will boost your melee damage, but not Thunderbolt.

Blessing's Boon can help keep your HP topped off, which is good, especially if you decide to use the Ritual Sword Talisman for extra Thunderbolt Damage, since you need to be at max HP for this to work.

 
ELDEN RING SANGUINE SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Dexterity/Arcane Build that uses the Rivers of Blood Katana to devastating effect.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Rivers of Blood, Sacrificial Axe, and Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask or Okina Mask, and any armor that allows you to med roll
Talismans: Lord of Blood's Exultation, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Carian Filigreed Crest, Shard of Alexander, and Green Turtle Talisman
Primary Stats: Arcane & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Corpse Piler
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you will carry Rivers of Blood in your right hand, and use Sacrificial Axe and Dragon Communion Seal in your left. Sacrificial Axe will give you 4 FP, even when you don't meet the requirements for it, every time you kill an enemy as long  as it's in your left hand. 

You'll use Rivers of Blood as your "default" attack, because we reduce the cost of it via Carian Filigreed Crest, and give you FP back with Sacrificial Axe. This combined with 30 or so Mind allows you to pretty much use it at will, as long as you have a few FP flasks.

You can buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength when you're heading into a Boss fight or a difficult enemy because Rivers of Blood does both Physical and Fire Damage, benefitting immensely from this Incantation. You can add others as well since you'll have fairly good Incantation Scaling thanks to the Dragon Communion Seal and high Arcane, but these are optional.

If you manage to acquire Millicent's Prosthesis and Rotten Sword Insignia you can actually use both, but you will need someone to drop you one or the other.

 

 
ELDEN RING VENOMOUS BLOODBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Quality Build that uses Bleed and Poison to boost Attack Power extremely high while dual wielding Curved Swords.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Scavenger's Curved Sword & Bandit's Curved Sword (if you can get a second Scavenger's Curved Sword from someone that would be better)
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask or Mushroom Crown & any that allows you to med roll
Talismans: Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia, Kindred of Rot's Exultation & Lord of Blood's Exultation
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Poisonous Mist & Seppuku
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll typically buff your left-hand weapon with Seppuku to increase its Bleed build up and damage and to trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation. Then you'll lead most fights with Poisonous Mist in order to set Poisoned to also boost your Attack Power by 30% thanks to the Mushroom Crown and Kindred of Rot's Exultation. 

You'll then swing repeatedly with L1, blending enemies down quickly to trigger both Millicent's Prosthesis and Rotten Winged Sword Insignia to further increase your Attack Power, giving you an Attack Rating of well over 1k with each Curved Sword. This allows you to attack rapidly with very high damage, with the occasional Hemorrhage proc, and while the enemy remains Poisoned.

If enemies are immune to Poisoned and Bleed, you can still trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation repeatedly with Seppuku as necessary and you can use the Raw Meat Dumpling to set Poisoned on yourself to gain Kindred of Rot's Exultation's buff.

 
ELDEN RING GRAVITY GOD BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A melee build that uses a ranged weapon ability to stagger and deal fantastic damage while remaining safely.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Fallingstar Beast Jaw & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Okina Mask, Raptor's Black Feathers, and any Armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Ritual Sword Talisman, Carian Filigreed Crest, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Gravity Bolt
Spells: Golden Vow & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow as you travel around using Gravity Bolt at will to destroy enemies before they can even attack you once. Because Gravity Bolt staggers most enemies in one cast, even if it doesn't kill them it will often disable them preventing them from reaching you.

Gravity Bolt does mostly Physical Damage, which is great against just about every enemy type in the game, and the stagger it provides allows you to stun lock many difficult enemies and Bosses repeatedly from a safe distance.

You can also deal good Jump Attack damage with this Build because it is a Colossal Weapon and because of Raptor's Black Feathers. If you want even more Jump Attack damage you can replace Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman with Claw Talisman.

 

 
ELDEN RING LIGHTNING DRAGOON BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) melee build that uses the Bolt of Gransax and a Greatshield to electrifying effect

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Bolt of Gransax & Cleanrot Spear or Treespear
Shield: Golden Greatshield
Armor: Consort's Mask & Leyndell Knight Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Radagon's Soreseal, Ritual Sword Talisman & Carian Filigreed Crest
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Strength & Endurance
Skills: Ancient Lightning Spear & Sacred Phalanx
Spells: Golden Vow , Blessing of the Erdtree, & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and you'll Block Counter as necessary. You'll use Bolt of Gransax as your primary weapon, dealing Physical and Lightning Damage, only swapping to Cleanrot Spear or Treespear when enemies resist Lighting Damage. Since you're using a Shield and Spear you can Block and attack at the same time, protecting yourself from attacks while also dealing damage.

You'll use Ancient Lightning Spear to pick off enemies at range as needed, particularly difficult enemies that can be killed quickly with it, or using it against Bosses when melee is not the best option. Ancient Lightning Spear hits much harder than the Lightning Spear Incantation, and costs about the same FP with this setup, and has much more range as well. You can charge it up for extra damage if you want, or just use it regularly when you don't have the spacing or time to do so.

This Build is a great blend of offense and defense because you can lead with Ancient Lightning Spear and then Block and attack or Block Counter for solid damage in melee when enemies get close. It's also very hard to kill because it can block very easily.

 
ELDEN RING BLACKFLAME BUSHIDO BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Faith Build that uses the Cross-Naginata to to set Hemorrhage and Black Flame on enemies in melee range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Cross-Naginata or Nagakiba & Godslayer's Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask & White Reed Set
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Radagon's Soreseal, Godfrey Icon & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Phantom Slash, Sword Dance or Double Slash
Spells: Golden Vow, Black Flame, Bloodflame Blade, Black Flame Blade, Scouring Black Flame, Black Flame Ritual & Black Flame's Protection
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and you'll use Bloodflame Blade to help set Hemorrhage on most regular enemies, as it adds to the native bleeding of the Cross-Naginata or Nagakiba. You'll then use Phantom Slash if you're using Cross-Naginata or Sword Dance or Double Slash if you're using Nagakiba.

Phantom Slash applies Bloodflame Blade if you're buffed with it to its attacks, and what's great is that it will connect even if you get staggered during your own attack animation, allowing you to stagger enemies in many cases, and allowing you to recover and attack. You'll have to choose your openings a bit more carefully when using Sword Dance or Double Slash, but Sword Dance still has fantastic range.

Black Flame Blade is used on more difficult enemies, and since you have high Faith the damage it adds to your attacks is substantial, and this is in addition to the Black Flame damage over time it places on the enemy. 

Black Flame is great for range when you need it, and Scouring Black Flame is a good AoE that can hit multiple enemies and is good at mid range when enemies are aggressive, and Black Flame might miss. Black Flame Ritual is fantastic against aggressive or large enemies and it hits like a truck. I like to charge it for a larger radius, making it hit more effectively and increasing its damage due to Godfrey Icon. Black Flame's Protection stacks with Golden Vow and will make you very very hard to kill.

 

 
ELDEN RING GOLDEN CHAMPION BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity-based tank build that can Block-Counter, Dual Wield and Parry all in one setup.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Ornamental Straight Sword & any Sacred Seal
Shield: Banished Knight's Shield
Armor: Banished Knight Set
Talismans: Winged Sword Insignia, Millicent's Prosthesis, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Spear Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Golden Tempering & Golden Parry
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing's Boon and Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Tempering, increasing your Holy Damage and changing your R2 to a special flurry that hits repeatedly with both swords, even if only one is currently equipped. You can use Golden Vow as necessary as well to help with more difficult areas and bosses, 

Ornamental Straight Sword is actually a "paired weapon" allowing you to single hand or dual wield them by pressing Triangle + R1. They are the only Straight Swords in the game that are paired.

You'll use your Sword and Shield setup most of the time, using Golden Parry to Parry enemies from a safe distance, and using your charged R2 to hit enemies repeatedly. Some tough enemies or Bosses you'll go hyper aggressive, and dual wield swinging through enemy attacks to increase your damage as quickly as possible, building up your damage thanks to your Talismans.

 
ELDEN RING BLACK KNIFE ASSASSIN BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Faith Build that uses dual Daggers to rapidly strike enemies and Bosses for high damage the further into combo chains you go.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Erdsteel Dagger x2, Black Knife & any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Black Knife Hood, Black Knife Armor, Fire Prelate Gauntlets & Fire Prelate Greaves
Talismans: Winged Sword Insignia, Millicent's Prosthesis, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor 
Skills: Blade of Death, Bloodhound's Step & Parry
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree and Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and then you'll use your L1 combos to stun lock most enemies, building up your Attack Power because of Millicent's Prosthesis and Winged Sword Insignia. You can use Bloodhound's Step to dodge easily, or you can use Quickstep if you find it difficult to use Bloodhound's Step.

Because you have high Poise from your Armor setup, and you because you'll be using the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, you can trade damage without being interrupted quite often, and you'll have very good protection. Golden Vow also provides you with some as well, so you can finish off your combos uninterrupted.

You can use Blessing of the Erdtree and Flame, Grant Me Strength to buff healing and damage for Boss fights. And you can use Blade of Death when you need a ranged option, because melee wouldn't work or work well. Parry is used when enemies cannot be stunlocked with repeated attacks, or when you cannot swing through attacks easily.

 

 
ELDEN RING SERPENT SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity Build that uses poison to great effect using the Serpentbone Blade and the Uchigatana.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Serpentbone Blade & Uchigatana (or Wakizashi)
Shield: 
Armor: Mushroom Crown & any high Poise Armor
Talismans: Kindred of Rot's Exultation, Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia, & Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Double Slash, Poison Moth Flight & Parry
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll be dual wielding the Serpentbone Blade and Uchigatana (or Wakizashi) most of the time, using L1 for dual wield combos when you want, or L2 for Double Slash if you need it.

I like to single hand the Serpentbone Blade when facing difficult enemies that don't stagger easily in order to use the Charged R2 attacks, which usually stagger them in two uses, often finishing them off quickly. Because you have high Poise, you can often swing through at least one attack from them.

The idea is to set the Poison Status effect using a Poison infused Uchigatana and Serpentbone Blade to boost Attack Power, as well as striking repeatedly to boost Attack Power, to crank out high damage per strike.

 
ELDEN RING BLOODY BOWMAN BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Strength Build that uses the Black Bow to unleash a Barrage of Blood and Poison Arrows at enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Black Bow
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask, any Light Armor
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Arrow's Sting Talisman, Spear Talisman (or Lord of Blood's Exultation)
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor 
Skills: Barrage
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use the Black Bow to range down enemies. Based on what enemies you are facing, you'll use regular Arrows for trash enemies, or enemies that you won't get much out of triggering Hemorrhage or Poison on because they'll be dead too quickly. Stock up on these, as you can purchase about 700 of them for 7k Runes or so.

You'll use Serpent Arrows and Bloodbone Arrows (Fletched) to deal with tough enemies and Bosses. Using the Barrage ability of Black Bow will allows you to set these Statuses very easily through rapid attacks, but will also deal decent damage in their own right.

Save the Bloodbone Arrows for Bosses because of the three types they are the only ones that are crafted, making them a bit more difficult to get, though it's not incredibly hard at this stage. Note that making the Fletched version is ideal, because it increases the Range of these Arrows. When arrows lands outside of their range they deal reduced damage, so having better Range keeps your damage higher.

 

 
ELDEN RING HOWLING STARFIST BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity Build that uses Fists to set Bleeding and to range down enemies with Beast's Roar.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Star Fist, Highland Axe & Frenzied Flame Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask, and any other Armor that gives you lots of Poise
Talismans: Roar Medallion, Shard of Alexander, Lord of Blood's Exultation, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Beast's Roar
Spells: Bloodflame Blade
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Bloodflame Blade as necessary in order to add more Bleeding build up to your Star Fist, which you will be dual wielding. Attacking repeatedly will not only increase your Attack Power thanks to Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, but also because you will eventually trigger Hemorrhage, triggering White Mask and Lord of Blood's Exultation, further boosting Attack Power.

Charged R2 attacks are very good with the Star Fist because they deal exceptional stance damage, and also count as two-hits, dealing incredible damage and building up Bleed faster than some other Fist R2s. Use them when you can.

Beast's Roar is there to give you a ranged option. This is a Dexterity-based Ash of War, meaning you will want to change your Affinity to Keen on your Star Fist to get the most out of it. This Ash of War has tremendous range and decent damage, allowing you to shore up the weakest aspect of Fist Weapons, range. Use this when you can't get close enough to an enemy to be effective, or if it's just easier to range them down.

 
ELDEN RING NEBULA KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Dexterity/Intelligence Build that uses the Wing of Astel to great effect by capitalizing on its weapon skill Nebula.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Wing of Astel and any Staff
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Scaled Armor Set or any Armor with high Poise
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Shard of Alexander, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Curved Sword Talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Nebula
Spells: Scholar's Shield & Terra Magica
The Nebula Knight Build uses a combination of Block Counters and the weapon skill of Wing of Astel: Nebula to handle any situation effectively. Because Wing of Astel scales well with both Dexterity and Intelligence, we don't use a Great Shield for this Build, due to low Strength. Carian Knight's Shield is an excellent choice for those using a Shield with no Strength investment. And because Scholar's Shield further increases its mitigations and Guard Boost, it only gets even more effective.

Wing of Astel has a unique R2 attack and charged R2 attack that fires 1 or 2 waves of magic forward, depending on whether you charged it or not. These waves deal 100% Magic Damage (just like Nebula), making them benefit greatly from Magic Scorpion as well as Terra Magica. The waves, however, do not benefit from the Axe Talisman, though the damage you deal with the sword itself does. These waves also increase in damage based on your Intelligence, making it imperative for this Build.

Nebula is really your go to for Boss encounters, and it shoots out star clusters in front of you that explode dealing Magic Damage. They group up in tight spaces, but fan out in open locations. You can cast Nebula and then follow up with a Charged R2 for great stagger damage, or just spam Nebula.

 

 
ELDEN RING INQUISITOR BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that focuses on the use of the Ghiza's Wheel Colossal Weapon for optimal damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Ghiza's Wheel
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still medium roll
Talismans: Axe Talisman, Lord of Blood's Exultation, Claw Talisman & Millicent's Prosthesis
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Vigor
Skills: Contagious Fury
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use the one-handed R2 and one-handed charged R2 attacks of Ghiza's Wheel to take advantage of Axe Talisman, and to give you hyper armor, but most importantly to hit multiple times as the wheel spins when it lands. If you two-hand this weapon then it spins behind you instead of in front of you, so it's important to one-hand it and use these R2 attacks, because R1s don't make the wheel spin.

Spinning Wheel does not trigger Hemorrhage easily, and does not trigger Winged Sword Insignia or Millicent's Prosthesis, so it's not particularly useful for tough enemies so we don't use it often. Instead you'll use Jump Attack, buff with Contagious Fury to further boost your R2 damage, and use Charged R2s for even more damage and stagger.

When the wheel spins after an R2 or charged R2, you'll often trigger Hemorrhage in one attack, which will trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation and White Mask if you're using it. This boosts your Attack Power even higher, and you'll often trigger Millicent's Prosthesis at the same time, getting even higher attack rating.

 
ELDEN RING WATERFOWL WARRIOR BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity Build that uses Hand of Malenia to devastating results via Waterfowl Dance.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Hand of Malenia
Shield: None
Armor: They heaviest you can wear and still Medium Roll.
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman or Great-Jar's Arsenal
Primary Stats: Dexterity 
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Vigor 
Skills: Waterfowl Dance
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use the regular attacks of Hand of Malenia to deal with regular enemies, two-handing it in order to gain max damage and keep your equip load a bit lighter for more armor with higher Poise.

You'll use Waterfowl Dance on tough to kill enemies, packs of enemies and Bosses, using your high Poise and hyper armor of the skill to strike them repeatedly for very high damage, triggering Millicent's Prosthesis and Winged Sword Insignia, boosting repeated L2 damage.

Stamina is an issue for this Build because Waterfowl Dance eats it up, and you likely won't be able to use 3 consecutive L2 pulls twice, without waiting for your Stamina to replenish. Use Greenburst Crystal Tear when facing Bosses to keep your Stamina high, so you don't run out mid attack.

Unlike other Katana Builds, Hemorrhage doesn't play a huge roll in this Build because Waterfowl Dance doesn't build up Bleed fast at all, so don't worry about it, and don't try to maximize Bleeding Build Up.

 

 
ELDEN CARIAN CAVALIER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that uses a halberd to devastating results on horseback and on foot.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Loretta's War Sickle & any Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Royal Knight Set or any with high Poise
Talismans: Bull-Goat's Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia or Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Loretta's Slash
Spells: Freezing Mist
The way this Build works is that you'll use the very fast attacks of Loretta's War Sickle to melt enemies in one or two attacks, and Bosses in less than a minute. When you combine the fast attacks of the War Sickle with high Poise and Talismans like Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis you get very high DPS.

Casting Freezing Mist on a Boss first will debuff them and increase the damage you do to them before beginning your assault. I usually cast this an then try to keep them in the mist until Frostbite triggers and then go to town.

Halberds are exceptional on horseback because of their hitboxes and attack speed, so learn to fight from horseback when you can, and consider adding the Lance Talisman when doing so for even more damage.

Loretta's Slash is very situational, and this build is not setup to optimize its damage. However, it's great against enemies that hit hard since they can't stagger you out of it, allowing you to connect for damage 99% of the time. Trading damage is fine with this build since you have high protection.

 
ELDEN RING MAD KING BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
An Arcane/Faith/Dexterity Build that focuses on the use of Madness and Morgott's Cursed Sword.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Morgott's Cursed Sword, Dragon Communion Seal & Frenzied Flame Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Fire Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Arcane
Secondary Stats: Faith & Vigor
Skills: Cursed-Blood Slice
Spells: Swarm of Flies,Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Unendurable Frenzy, & Frenzied Burst
The way this Build works is that you'll use your high Arcane to build up Bleed and Madness quickly via attacks and spells. Swarm of Flies is a good opener on tough enemies that you can then use Cursed-Blood Slice against to set Hemorrhage, as well deal a good amount of damage.

Unendurable Frenzy can be used in boss fights after popping the Cerulean Hidden Tear to melt Bosses in just a few seconds. Just hold the button down and stay out of range of the enemy's attacks and you're golden.

Frenzied Burst is great for picking off enemies at long range when needed. It deals incredibly high damage and pierced the blocks of enemies. Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength are there to buff your damage further when needed.

 

 
ELDEN SOUL SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity Intelligence Build that uses the Nagakiba and Scholar's Armament to phenomenal result.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Nagakiba & Academy Glintstone Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Black Knife Set
Talismans: Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Magic Scorpion Charm & Millicent's Prosthesis
Primary Stats: Intelligence & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Double Slash
Spells: Greatblade Phalanx, Founding Rain of Stars, Unseen Form, Loretta's Greatbow, Carian Retaliation, Scholar's Armament, Terra Magica, Freezing Mist
The way this Build works is that you'll use Unseen Form and the Black Knife Set to sneak up on enemies getting easy backstabs and attacks. These two things will muffle your sound and make you harder to see.

You can use Greatblade Phalanx when you know enemies are going to come at you, and cast Freezing Mist on tough enemies and Bosses to soften up their defenses via the Frostbite status effect.

Cast Founding Rain of Stars at the beginning of Boss fights when they start to come at you, and try to fight around the AoE it creates for best results. Try to dodge and use Double Slash while they are still in the AoE of FRoS.

Loretta's Greatbow is useful for situations where you need some long range or things will be markedly more difficult, and you can use Carian Retaliation to parry projectiles, which is great.

Scholar's Armament is your buff to really boost your damage over the top of a magic infused or cold infused Nagakiba. By keeping it Keen and using Scholar's Armament you will have higher damage potential as long as it remanis buffed.

 
ELDEN SWORD SAINT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Dexterity/Faith/Strength Build that focuses on using the Sacred Relic Sword and Wave of Gold.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Sacred Relic Sword, Sword of Milos, and any Sacred Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor with high Poise, the higher the better.
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Carian Filigreed Crest, Claw Talisman, & Sacred Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Faith
Secondary Stats: Strength & Vigor
Skills: Wave of Gold
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength & Any other Incantations you want.
The way this Build works is that you'll use Wave of Gold to take out packs of large enemies and on Bosses that aren't Holy Damage Resistant. We use Carian Filigreed Crest and Sword of Milos to help manage FP, so you can use Wave of Gold often and not worry about how much FP it costs.

When facing Holy Resistant enemies you'll use Jump Attacks to take them out, since Sword of Milos deals 100% Physical Damage, and Sacred Relic Sword deals about 63% Physical Damage. This will allow you to still deal great damage when attacking this way, bypassing this resistance, and the Claw Talisman only boosts this damage further. You could use the Raptor's Black Feathers for even more Jump Attack Damage if you wish.

 

 
ELDEN RING SLUMBERING SWORDSTRESS BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that uses Sleep to dispatch enemies very quickly.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Sword of St. Trina x2
Shield: None
Armor: Any light armor that allows you to light roll
Talismans: Ancestral Spirit's Horn, Great-Jar's Arsenal, Millicent's Prosthesis, Winged Sword Insignia or Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Mists of Slumber
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use two Sword of St. Trina to dual wield attack enemies and set them asleep quickly while fighting them. Dual Wield attacks hit more rapidly than single attacks, allowing you to build up enemy Sleep bars much more quickly.

You can use Mists of Slumber to begin the fight, often putting enemies to sleep quickly, but if not your right hand weapon will be buffed with more Sleep build up. This will allow you to put the enemy to sleep more easily with follow up attacks.

 
ELDEN RING BLACK ARROW BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Bow Build that focuses on the use of the Black Bow to take down enemies and bosses at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, few FP
Weapon: Black Bow & any Seal that weighs zero
Shield: None
Armor: Little or no Armor
Talismans: Old Lord's Talisman, Arrow's Sting Talisman, Shard of Alexander (or Ritual Sword Talisman) & Blue Dancer Charm
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Faith
Skills: Barrage
Spells: Golden Vow, and Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and use Barrage against hard to kill enemies, otherwise you'll jump shoot and land shoot enemies or roll shoot them with your Bow, since Black Bow operates like a Shortbow, allowing you to do this.

Flame, Grant Me Strength is useful when you need even more damage. You do 100% physical damage with this build, so this really helps out, and the Old Lord's Talisman helps extend the duration so you don't have to rebuff so quickly.

Blue Dancer Charm gives you a decent amount of damage with this build as long as you can keep your equip load low.

 

 
ELDEN RING ELDEN LORD BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Quality (Strength/Dexterity) Build that uses Axe of Godfrey and its weapon skill Regal Roar to pancake foes.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Axe of Godfrey & Highland Axe
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Roar Medallion, Shard of Alexander, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman & Axe Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Regal Roar
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll use Regal Roar on a tough enemy or group of enemies in order to knock them into the air, dealing substantial damage while also changing your R2 and charged R2 attacks and buffing your damage. Roar Medallion and Highland Axe both buff your Roar and follow up attack damage.

You'll then proceed to attack with R2s and charged R2s to pound enemies to death quickly, trading damage as necessary, since you'll win every trade. You can rebuff with Regal Roar as necessary, making sure to use it when bosses are just walking into the edge of it, which should give you time to cast it and follow up with R2 without getting hit more than once, so you aren't staggered.

 
ELDEN RING DRAGONSCALE DAIMYO BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A melee build that focuses on the use of Dragonscale Blade and its weapon skill: Ice Lightning Sword.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Dragonscale Blade & Uchigatana
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll.
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Shard of Alexander & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Ice Lightning Sword & Flaming Strike
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll buff your Fire Uchigatana with Flaming Strike and then use Ice Lightning Sword on an enemy or boss in order to deal some damage while also adding Lightning Damage to your Dragonscale Blade, as well as adding Frostbite build up to its attacks. This will allow you very high damage with repeated strikes while dual wielding.

Or you can use the Jellyfish Shield in your left hand instead of the Fire Uchigatana, which will allow you to use Ice Lightning Sword while two-handing, buffing your weapon, and then swapping to one hand and using Contagious Fury on the Shield to get even more damage. You can reach over 900 Attack Power this way, which is deadly.

 

 
ELDEN RING STORMBLADE BUILD (ALL LEVELS)
A Dexterity warrior that focuses on melee attacks and the liberal use of Storm Blade to annihilate foes at any distance.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split FP & HP
Weapon: Flamberge
Shield: None
Armor: Any Armor that allows you to medium roll.
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Ritual Sword Talisman, Millicent's Prosthesis, Carian Filigreed Crest or Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind & Endurance
Skills: Storm Blade
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Electrify Armament & Bloodflame Blade
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and Electrify Armament if needed while on the landscape, attacking enemies at range with Storm Blade, and dealing extra damage when they are in melee range due to the hit box of the weapon itself and the added Lightning Damage from Electrify Armament.

When you face bosses you'll want to buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength, Golden Vow and Bloodflame Blade and then get into melee range ASAP and start spamming Storm Blade. Because the weapon itself also connects, you deal incredible damage, and you also build up Hemorrhage, which then rips off another huge chunk of HP.

The idea here is that you replace your regular R1 and R2 attacks with L2 since it: a) swings faster, b) deals more damage and c) can be used at range or in melee.

 
ELDEN RING RIME RONIN BUILD (ALL LEVELS)
A Dexterity/Intelligence build that uses the Nagakiba and the Chilling Mist Ash of War.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP
Weapon: Nagakiba & Black Bow
Shield: None
Armor: Zamor Set or any that allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Bull-Goat's Talisman and Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Intelligence
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Chilling Mist
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll lead off with Chilling Mist, using it to set the Frostbite Status Effect on your target, while simultaneously buffing your Cold Nagakiba with even more Frostbite Build up. Frostbite will allow you to deal more damage to your target, while ripping off 10% of the targets max HP. 

You can use the Black Bow in 2 ways. First you can use it with Fire Arrows to remove the Frostbite Status Effect so you can reapply it and take another 10% HP of the target. This doesn't always make sense when the target doesn't have much health remaining or it's just easier to have the increased damage buff from Frostbite, so you won't do this all the time.

The second use is by using Cold Bone Arrows to help set the Frostbite Status Effect at range, either after you've stripped it off or leading with it in a fight to get some Frostbite built up before you use Chilling Mist.

 

 
ELDEN RING VAMPIRIC KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A melee build that focuses on out healing damage taken while shredding enemies to death with the Butchering Knife.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Butchering Knife
Shield: Icon Shield
Armor: Any armor with high Poise and protection, the higher the better
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Blessed Dew Talisman, Shard of Alexander, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: None
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll stack healing over time effects so that you keep gaining health while trading damage. Icon Shield and Blessed Dew Talisman both heal you over time, and Butchering Knife heals you for 1% of your max HP per strike. When combined with high Armor you are extremely tough to kill.

Wild Strikes is a fantastic Ash of War for this Weapon because it strikes rapidly helping to trigger that 1% heal more often as well as increasing your Attack Power via Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, and it has hyper Armor making it difficult for you to be interrupted. Additionally you can R1 or R2 out of Wild Strikes for more attacks that can often finish off enemies and Boss or minimally stagger them depending on how much you've hit them already.

 
ELDEN RING NOBLE SWORDSMAN BUILD (ALL GAME)
The Noble Swordsman Build is Dexterity build and an essential "all-game" build that players can use throughout the entirety of the game. This build uses a single straight sword, it does not come equipped with any other weapon or shield, and it is phenomenal for stance-breaking and critical attacks.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Noble's Slender Sword or Lordsworn's Straight Sword
Shield: N/A
Armor: Aristocrat Hat, Page Garb, Perfumer Gloves, Page Trousers
Talismans: Blue Dancer Charm, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Alternate Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Dagger Talisman, Assassin's Cerulean Dagger
Primary Stats: Dexterity, Vigor, Mind
Secondary Stats: Strength, Endurance
Skills: Square Off
Seal: N/A
Spells: N/A
Great Runes: Radahn's Great Rune
The Noble Swordsman Build for Elden Ring is an early-game build that new players must try, we highly recommend this when you start the game, and eventually, it can still be used and it will carry you until end-game. To make this build work, first off, you need to acquire a straight sword, and these weapons are either the Noble's Slender Sword or Lordsworn's Straight Sword weapon. The Noble's Slender Sword is what we highly recommend and is what we use for this build since is that it has a longer reach and better points in terms of damage output.

Both weapons have the Square Off skill which is one of the best Ashes of War in Elden Ring. It costs less FP and its attacks from using it cause high damage and ultimately, break a boss stance from successfully landing up to 2 or 3 hits. When playing this build, you want to be able to use Square Off as much as you can and less of the basic attacks, because once an enemy or boss falls to the ground, you can follow up with a critical attack.

As far as Talismans, it will depend on what these accessories can complement when it comes to the player's build:

Since the build uses pieces of light armor, the Blue Dancer Charm is great for boosting the damage with it.
Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard boosts the attack power of Square Off.
Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman provides defensive values by reducing Physical Damage taken by 20%.
A few other notes to highlight is that this build is versatile, you can use "Grease" items to coat and buff your weapon with different elements depending on the weakness of the enemy or boss you are fighting. This way it gives the player flexibility and to easily adapt to the situation at hand. Also, you may want to stack up with the Exalted Flesh which temporarily boosts the Physical Attack. Finally, using Radahn's Great Rune in our opinion works perfectly for this build since it raises the player's maximum HP, FP, and Stamina.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLOODY BALLERINA BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
An Arcane Build that focuses on the use of the Bloody Helice weapon and its weapon skill: Dynast's Finesse

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Bloody Helice
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask, and any other Armor you want
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Lord of Blood's Exultation, Green Turtle Talisman and Viridian Amber Medallion +2
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Dynast's Finesse
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll be using Dynast's Finesse during your tough enemy and Boss fights, while using R1 and R2 attacks on trash enemies to conserve FP.

Dynast's Finesse allows you to i-frame though attacks much more easily than dodging, and it can be used with maximum equip load, meaning you can wear extremely heavy armor if you wish, particularly because you will need high Endurance for this Build. 

The follow up attack of Dynast's Finesse will get you back into melee range, and does significant Stance Damage, allowing you to stagger enemies quite easily. Further attacks usually trigger Hemorrhage, which will proc your Attack Power buffs from Lord of Blood's Exultation and White Mask, allowing you to pump out even more damage as the fight goes on. When the enemy counter attacks, simply use L2 again to i-frame away and repeat this process.

Dynast's Finesse uses considerable amount of Stamina to both spin away and attack, so you need TONS of Stamina to be able to maneuver as much as you want with this Build. This is why have high Endurance, use the the Green Turtle Talisman, and Viridian Amber Medallion and you could even use the Green Turtle Shield on your back for more Stamina regen.

 
ELDEN RING DRAGON DANCER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
An Arcane Build that focuses on the use of Dragon Incantations.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Regalia of Eochaid & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Silver Tear Mask and any Armor
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, & Godfrey Icon
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind & Faith
Skills: Eochaid's Dancing Blade
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Dragonclaw, Dragonmaw, Agheel's Flame, Ekzyke's Decay, & Greyoll's Roar
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and then try to use your weapon skill: Eochaid's Dancing Blade on at least one enemy to ramp up your Attack Power from your Talismans. Then you can R1 attack enemies, rebuffing with Dancing Blade as necessary to keep your Attack Power up.

On Bosses you'll buff with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength and then use Eochaid's Dancing Blade when you have an opening, followed by a Dragonmaw for devastating damage after your Attack Power has been buffed high from the weapon skill.

You can use Dragonmaw on tough to kill mobile enemies, and Agheel's Flame and Ekzyke's Decay on groups of enemies, or when you need to set Scarlet Rot. Greyoll's Roar can be used to debuff a Boss if you need extra damage, just make sure to use it first for best results.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLOOD DRAGON BUILD (LEVEL 50)
A dual-wielding Arcane Build that uses Bleeding and Dragon Spells to obliterate enemies.

Class: Warrior or Bandit
Flask Spread: Split between HP and FP
Weapon: Dual Scimitars or any other Curved Swords that can use Ashes of War & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still med roll
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Dexterity, Faith and Endurance
Skills: Bloody Slash
Spells: Dragonclaw & Rotten Breath
The way this Build works is that you will Duplicate the Ashes of War: Bloody Slash to put it on both your Scimitars (or other curved swords), and select the Bleed Affinity so that they both apply Bleed build up when they hit an enemy. This will also allow them to scale with Arcane, which both increases their outright damage, and also increases the amount of Bleed build up they apply when hitting an enemy, making enemies Hemorrhage more quickly, ripping off huge chunks of HP.

You can use Bloody Slash against more difficult enemies and Bosses, and its damage increases with weapon upgrades and Arcane, so the more you increase Arcane the more damage this Skill will do.

Dragonclaw is your Spell for tough enemies that turtle behind Shields, making it hard for you to get to them with your Swords. If you have 84 FP you can cast this again much more quickly than the first cast, allowing for a "two-hit" combo that should kill almost anything. It also has hyper armor, allowing you to pull it off through even the heaviest of attacks. You need 15 Mind for 84 FP.

Rotten Breath wipes out packs of enemies easily, and can be used from Horseback. Use this on hard to kill Bosses and enemies as it does incredible damage over time if you can build up their Scarlet Rot bar enough. It's easy mode with this Spell.

 
ELDEN RING BLOOD DANCER BUILD (LEVEL 100)
An Bleed Build focused on Arcane and the use of Eleonora's Poleblade to deal incredible damage very quickly and set the Hemorrhage status effect.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Eleonora's Poleblade & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Mask of Confidence, and any armor as long as you can med roll
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind & Dexterity
Skills: Bloodblade Dance
Spells: Dragonclaw, Dragonice, Rotten Breath, Flame, Grant Me Strength & Lightning Spear
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength for tough fights to boost both your Physical and Fire Damage, and Eleonora's Poleblade does both.

You can use Dragonice to wipe out packs of enemies or to set Frostbite on Bosses, though you'll want to lead with Rotten Breath first if they can be effected by Scarlet Rot.

Lightning Spear can be used to pick off lone enemies at range, or to range down a single target, and Dragonclaw is used situationally when you need burst Physical Damage.

Most of the time you'll be leading with Bloodblade Dance to stagger enemies and to Hemorrhage them as quickly as you can. You can swing over and over with L2 to keep building up this Status and to keep staggering enemies.

 

 
ELDEN RING DRAGON KNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 100)
An Arcane/Faith Build that focuses on the use of Dragon Spells, as well as boosting general Incantation and melee damage.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Any that can use Bloody Slash & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Silver Tear Mask, and any armor that allows you to med roll
Talismans: Radagon's Soreseal, Fire Scorpion Charm, Magic Scorpion Charm, Faithful's Canvas Talisman & Curved Sword Talisman
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Faith & Mind
Skills: Bloody Slash & Contagious Fury
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing's Boon, Lightning Spear, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Black Flame, Stone of Gurranq, Agheel's Flame, Smarag's Glintstone Breath, Rotten Breath
The way this Build works is that you'll increase your Arcane to make your Spells hit hard, and to boost the damage of your Weapon. You should use an Occult Affinity Weapon, with the Bloody Slash Skill, which scales with Arcane for maximum Bloody Slash damage, but you can use any Skill you want.

You need at least 25 Faith to use Golden Vow, and 23 to use certain Dragon Spells, so you can't have less than this. You'll use your Jellyfish Shield's ability: Contagious Fury to boost your Spell Damage and Weapon Damage, and Golden Vow to do the same. You can then chuck Lightning Spears or Black Flame balls at enemies or use Bloody Slash.

You'll use Agheel's Flame or Smarag's Glintstone Breath to take out enemies with larger health pools or Bosses, holding down R1 to cast the spell fully twice. This absolutely melts Bosses, especially when you are buffed with Contagious Fury and Golden Vow. Make sure to equip the Scorpion Charm that best suits the breath you intend to use.

 
ELDEN RING FRENZIED ACOLYTE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
An Arcane/Faith Build that focuses on casting incantations from range, only meleeing when absolutely necessary.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly FP, some HP
Weapon: Dragon Communion Seal, Frenzied Flame Seal, Gravel Stone Seal, Godslayer's Seal & any melee Weapon that can take an Ash of War
Shield: None
Armor: Silver Tear Mask, Commoner's Garb, Noble's Glove, Noble's Trousers
Talismans: Godfrey Icon, Ritual Sword Talisman, Faithful's Canvas Talisman & Fire Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Arcane & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Bloodhound's Step
Spells: The Flame of Frenzy, Frenzied Burst, Black Flame, Lightning Spear, Golden Vow & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll use the Dragon Communion Seal in your right hand to cast spells, because it has better Incantation Scaling at this point in the game, and you'll keep the other Seals in your off hand, rotating them to boost the damage of whichever spell you might be casting. For instance, you'd have the Godslayer's Seal in your left hand when casting Black Flame, and rotate to Frenzied Flame Seal when casting The Flame of Frenzy or Frenzied Burst, and Gravel Stone Seal when casting Lightning Spear.

You'll use The Flame of Frenzy spell on large enemies that don't move to quickly or groups of enemies to take them out quickly. Frenzied Burst is your long range sniping spell that will kill most enemies before they can even react, and charging it makes it go through Shields.

Black Flame is there when you don't need either of these to kill enemies, and will conserve some FP, as well as deal damage over time based on the Max HP of the target. Lighting Spear can be cast when Fire is not a good damage type.

You'll buff with Golden Vow and Flame Grant Me Strength as necessary. Often time you won't need these to one shot most enemies, but if you aren't killing most enemies in one cast then you'll want to use Golden Vow. Use Flame, Grant Me Strength for Boss encounters or tough enemies.

 

 
ELDEN RING SANGUINE SAMURAI BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Dexterity/Arcane Build that uses the Rivers of Blood Katana to devastating effect.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, some FP
Weapon: Rivers of Blood, Sacrificial Axe, and Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask or Okina Mask, and any armor that allows you to med roll
Talismans: Lord of Blood's Exultation, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Carian Filigreed Crest, Shard of Alexander, and Green Turtle Talisman
Primary Stats: Arcane & Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Skills: Corpse Piler
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you will carry Rivers of Blood in your right hand, and use Sacrificial Axe and Dragon Communion Seal in your left. Sacrificial Axe will give you 4 FP, even when you don't meet the requirements for it, every time you kill an enemy as long  as it's in your left hand. 

You'll use Rivers of Blood as your "default" attack, because we reduce the cost of it via Carian Filigreed Crest, and give you FP back with Sacrificial Axe. This combined with 30 or so Mind allows you to pretty much use it at will, as long as you have a few FP flasks.

You can buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength when you're heading into a Boss fight or a difficult enemy because Rivers of Blood does both Physical and Fire Damage, benefitting immensely from this Incantation. You can add others as well since you'll have fairly good Incantation Scaling thanks to the Dragon Communion Seal and high Arcane, but these are optional.

If you manage to acquire Millicent's Prosthesis and Rotten Sword Insignia you can actually use both, but you will need someone to drop you one or the other.

 
ELDEN RING EOCHAID EXECUTIONER BUILD (LEVEL 150)
A Strength/Arcane Build that uses the Marais Executioner's Sword or Regalia of Eochaid to deal massive damage via Eochaid's Dancing Blade

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Marais Executioner's Sword or Regalia of Eochaid 
Shield: Banished Knight's Shield or any Shield you like
Armor: Any that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Millicent's Prosthesis, Shard of Alexander, and Green Turtle Talisman or Godfrey Icon
Primary Stats: Strength & Arcane
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Eochaid's Dancing Blade
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this Build works is that you'll use Eochaid's Dancing Blade on just about every enemy, when you aren't doing Block Counters off of your Blocks. You're goal is always to get at least one enemy with this Skill in order to boost your Attack Power via Rotten Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis so that subsequent attacks deal more damage.

Eochaid's Dancing Blade scales off of Strength and Arcane primarily, so you want to invest points heavily here in order to boost its damage as high as possible. Additionally, you can charge this Ability to increase its reach and duration (and also damage if you're using Godfrey Icon), making it more effective, though this isn't always easy to pull off.

You can buff with Flame, Grant Me Strength as needed, since you do mostly Physical Damage with your attacks and with Eochaid's Dancing Blade. This will likely be before tough enemies, and bosses, for best results.

Don't forget that you can Block Counter enemies with your Shield by pressing R2 after blocking, and if you stagger an enemy can do a Charged L2 to finish them off quite easily.

 

 
ELDEN RING DRAGON WARRIOR BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Arcane Build that uses Bleed and rapid attacks to build up Attack Power and then unleash deadly Dragon attacks.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Bandit's Curved Sword x2 or any Curved Swords
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask, and heavy armor with good Poise
Talismans: Lord of Blood's Exultation, Primal Glintstone Blade, Millicent's Prosthesis and Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Faith & Endurance
Skills: Seppuku x2
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing's Boon, Ekzyke's Decay, Dragonclaw & Dragonmaw
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and Seppuku when generally moving about the landscape to attack enemies, only buffing your right hand weapon unless facing something fierce. You can use Blessing's Boon and buff your left hand weapon as well when facing tough enemies or Bosses to further boost damage and surviveability.

You'll try to do running L1 attacks to proc Hemorrhage as quickly as possible, which boosts your Attack Power by 30% thanks to Lord of Blood's Exultation and White Mask. Follow up with L1s until you complete a combo, which will have boosted your Attack Power even higher thanks to Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis, and then swap to your Dragon Communion Seal and fire off 1 or two Dragonclaw or Dragonmaws to hit for crazy high damage.

You can use Ekzyke's Decay to set Scarlet Rot on tough Bosses from range, or to AoE down groups of enemies from a distance. 

(Note: Patch 1.07 nerfed the additional bleed build up gained from Sepukku and also the status damage done when dual wielding. However, as the aim of the build is to activate blood loss and the multi-hit bonus from Millicent's Prosthesis/Winged Sword Insignia in order to have maximum strength Dragonclaw/Dragonmaw. Due to this, the nerfs don't affect the build as much as you would think. This is because in order to get the multi-hit bonus, you want to do a L1 combo, at which point you will almost certainly have triggered a bleed anyway - especially seeing as you have two blood affinity curved swords and may have used sepukku on 1-2 of your swords as well.)

 
ELDEN RING MAGIC DRAGONKNIGHT BUILD (LEVEL 150)
An Arcane Build that uses Dragon Spells to their fullest, melting Bosses and enemies in mere seconds.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Ripple Blade & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Silver Tear Mask & other Armor with good Poise
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Curved Sword Talisman & Flock's Canvas Talisman
Primary Stats: Arcane
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Contagious Fury
Spells: Golden Vow, Smarag's Glintstone Breath, Agheel's Flame, Borealis's Mist, & Ekzyke's Decay
The way this Build works is that you'll buff with Golden Vow and use Block-Counters to deal with trash enemies. Most regular attacks bounce off the Jellyfish Shield because it's a Greatshield, making Block-Counters easier, and the damage of these is increased by the Curved Sword Talisman.

Smarag's Glintstone Breath is your go to Dragon Spell, as it deals a ton of damage, and outperforms Borealis's Mist in the majority of cases, except when enemies have huge HP pools, setting Frostbite may benefit you more here if you can't kill the Boss fast enough with Smarag's Glintstone Breath.

Agheel's Flame is a nice Fire alternative to Smarag's Glintstone Breath, and you should use the Fire Scorpion Charm instead of Magic Scorpion Charm when using this one. Ezyke's Decay is good against tough enemies that you may need the Scarlet Rot status effect against, but it isn't always needed.

Use the Cerulean Hidden Tear when beginning Boss fights to remove FP cost for 10 seconds, in order to nuke Bosses before they can even attack.

(Patch 1.07 decrease the damage of breath spells in PvP. Makes this build less powerful in PvP, but it's still effective in PvE.)

 

 
ELDEN RING MAD KING BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
An Arcane/Faith/Dexterity Build that focuses on the use of Madness and Morgott's Cursed Sword.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP some FP
Weapon: Morgott's Cursed Sword, Dragon Communion Seal & Frenzied Flame Seal
Shield: None
Armor: Heaviest you can wear and still medium roll
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Fire Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman & Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Dexterity & Arcane
Secondary Stats: Faith & Vigor
Skills: Cursed-Blood Slice
Spells: Swarm of Flies, Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Unendurable Frenzy, & Frenzied Burst
The way this Build works is that you'll use your high Arcane to build up Bleed and Madness quickly via attacks and spells. Swarm of Flies is a good opener on tough enemies that you can then use Cursed-Blood Slice against to set Hemorrhage, as well deal a good amount of damage.

Unendurable Frenzy can be used in boss fights after popping the Cerulean Hidden Tear to melt Bosses in just a few seconds. Just hold the button down and stay out of range of the enemy's attacks and you're golden.

Frenzied Burst is great for picking off enemies at long range when needed. It deals incredibly high damage and pierced the blocks of enemies. Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength are there to buff your damage further when needed.

 
ELDEN RING CRIMSON DUELIST BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
An Arcane build that uses Rogier's Rapier and Sepukku to bleed enemies to death very quickly.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP
Weapon: Rogier's Rapier 
Shield: Any Small Shield
Armor: White Mask and light armor for Light Equip Load setup.
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Lord of Blood's Exultation and Spear Talisman (or Dagger Talisman)
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance
Skills: Seppuku and Carian Retaliation
Spells: None
The way this Build works is that you'll buff yourself with Seppuku and use the unique R2 attack of Rogier's Rapier that hits twice to one shot most enemies, triggering blood loss with nearly every R2 attack, boosting your Attack Power from White Mask and Lord of Blood's Exultation, as well as Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis. This gives you very high Attack Rating very quickly, and is easy to maintain since you can one shot most every enemy quickly.

By using Carian Retaliation on a Shield in your left hand you will be have the most possible frames for Parrying, making it easier to Parry than just about any other setup. This allows you to get Critical Attacks when needed, when you aren't focusing on R2s of course. You can also Parry spells, and fling them back at casters for more damage as well.

 

 
ELDEN RING SANGUINE SPELLBLADE BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
An Arcane/Intelligence Build that focuses on the use of Thorn Sorceries to make enemies bleed at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split HP and FP
Weapon: Albinauric Staff, Dragon Communion Seal, Staff of the Guilty & Rogier's Rapier
Shield: None
Armor: Alberich's Set (for extra Thorn Sorcery damage)
Talismans: Graven-Mass Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm, Lord of Blood's Exultation & Taker's Cameo
Primary Stats: Arcane & Vigor
Secondary Stats: Intelligence & Faith
Skills: Seppuku
Spells: Golden Vow, Blessing of the Erdtree, Terra Magica, Unseen Form, Briars of Punishment & Briars of Sin
The way this Build works is that you'll use Seppuku on your Rapier to add to its Bleed Infused Build Up, and also trigger Lord of Blood's Exultation on yourself. This will boost your sorcery damage, so that you can one shot most enemies with Briars of Punishment.

You can buff also with Golden Vow if you need more damage, and you can use Blessing of the Erdtree if you find you are taking too much damage from your own spells, though Taker's Cameo should offset this in most cases.

Be sure to use Terra Magica when starting boss fights for increased damage, and use Roger's Rapier to melee enemies that get close to you re-triggering Lord of Blood's Exultation.

 
ELDEN RING GRIM REAPER BUILD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
A Strength/Arcane build that uses a Reaper and the Stormcaller Ash of War to shred enemies in seconds.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP
Weapon: Grave Scythe & Dragon Communion Seal
Shield: None
Armor: White Mask and and the heaviest Armor that still allows you to medium roll
Talismans: Rotten Winged Sword Insignia (or Winged Sword Insignia), Millicent's Prosthesis, Lord of Blood's Exultation and Shard of Alexander
Primary Stats: Arcane & Strength
Secondary Stats: Vigor
Skills: Stormcaller
Spells: Bloodflame Blade, Poison Armament, Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Poison Mist and Swarm of Flies
The way this Build works is that you'll buff your Scythe with Bloodflame Blade and use Stormcaller to rapidly strike enemies or Bosses for high damage and decent Bleed Build Up. The Grave Scythe has native Bleed Build Up on hit, and when combined with Bloodflame Blade, this only becomes more effective.

Stormcaller allows you to hit many many times in rapid succession, charging up your Rotten Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis talismans, while also triggering White Mask and Lord of Blood's Exultation. This results in insane Attack Power, particularly when buffed with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength, where you can reach over 2500!

Poison Armament and Poison Mist are useful against Bleed Immune enemies, providing you an option in these cases. You can also use Mushroom Crown and Kindred of Rot's Exultation in these cases to keep your Attack Power high.

 

 
ELDEN RING CARIAN CLEAVER BUILD (ALL GAME)
Carian Cleaver is a hybrid build that can be used early in the game and ultimately, towards the endgame, including New Game Plus. The Carian Cleaver build highlights high damage of spellcasting and melee attacks. If you're looking for that balance between casting spells and being effective in melee combat, then this build is for you.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Iron Cleaver, Carian Regal Scepter
Shield: Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Carian Knight Helm, Carian Knight Armor, Banished Knight Gauntlets, Banished Knight Greaves
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Axe Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm
Primary Stats: Intelligence, Vigor, Mind
Secondary Stats: Endurance, Strength
Skills: Royal Knight's Resolve
Spells: Greatblade Phalanx
Crystal Tear: Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear, Spiked Cracked Tear
Great Runes: Radahn's Great Rune
The Elden Ring Carian Cleaver Build is an NG+ Intelligence build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for an Axe build that cleaves through anything and everything in the game, then you might want to check this build-out. For this build to work you'll need to acquire the Iron Cleaver for melee combat and set it to magic infusion to acquire that high damage value, the reason why we picked this weapon apart from its high damage value is its R2 attack which allows the character to charge and lunge forward to close the gap when attacking an enemy. To further boost the weapon's attack, pairing it with the Royal Knight's Resolve skill makes it seamless to damage and kill enemies.

As for the spellcasting aspect of this build, the Carian Regal Scepter is the primary staff weapon for this build, but early on, you can use the Meteorite Staff or Academy Glintstone Staff, then switch out to the Regal Scepter once you have it. Carian Regal Scepter is a must for this build since the character has high Intelligence, making it a good pair with the magic-infused Iron Cleaver. When it comes to spells, you can use what you prefer but the Greatblade Phalanx is one of the spells we recommend for this build just for added offense and defense. The effect of this spell can follow up with a combo such as casting the spell, then using the R2 charge attack from the Iron Cleaver, and by closing the cap with the melee move, it triggers the spell, resulting in stance breaking, high damage, or just killing the target quickly.

For shields, this build uses the Jellyfish Shield. It's a good addition for defense and countering enemy attacks but the main highlight is using the shield's skill "Contagious Fury" to further buff your damage by 20%. The best way to do this is to equip your scepter and axe weapons > use Royal Knight's Resolve > switch the scepter to the shield > and then use Contagious Fury. When it comes to Armor, you can use what you prefer, but for this build, the following pieces are used (Carian Knight Helm, Carian Knight Armor, Banished Knight Gauntlets, Banished Knight Greaves) for added poise value and to take as much hits if I'm put in a tricky situation and when spamming attacks.

This build also recommends the following Talismans (Ritual Sword Talisman, Axe Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm) to raise the attack power of the axe weapon, melee attacks, and magic damage. And the last slot for the talisman depends on the situation or your preference: If you are fighting a boss Rotten Winged Sword Insignia or Millicent's Prosthesis are good alternatives, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman for increased Physical Defense, Dagger Talisman to increase Critical Hits, and even Curved Sword Talisman to increase the guard counter damage.

 
ELDEN RING VANQUISHER BUILD (ALL GAME)
The Vanquisher Build is an "all-game" build that players can use fairly at the beginning of the game and until the end. The highlight of this build is the Dragon Halberd weapon, making it special because of the skill that is associated, which is the Ash of War: Spinning Slash that buffs the damage with Ice Lightning by 160 Lightning Damage and 80 Frost build up for 45 seconds. Not only does it have great damage, but the weapon has a decent guard boost.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Dragon Halberd
Shield: --
Armor: Gelmir Knight Helm, Gelmir Knight Armor, Cuckoo Knight Gauntlets, Gelmir Knight Greaves
Talismans: Shard of Alexander, Ritual Sword Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Spear Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength, Vigor, Dexterity
Secondary Stats: Mind
Skills: Spinning Slash
Spells: Flame Grant Me Strength
Crystal Tear: Strength-Knot Crystal Tear, Dexterity-Knot Crystal Tear, or Greenburst Crystal Tear
Great Runes: Radahn's Great Rune or Godrick's Great Rune
Another All-Game build is the Vanquisher build which focuses on Strength and Dexterity. Primarily, you'll want to acquire the main item for this build to work, which is the Dragon Halberd. The Dragon Halberd weapon can be acquired in the early stages of the game if you're playing for the first time, and this is dropped by the Dragonkin Soldier boss located in Siofra River. The reason why this weapon is interesting is how it is empowered with Ice Lightning when using the Ash of War: Spinning Slash, when you use the skill, it buffs the weapon damage with Ice Lightning by 160 Lightning Damage and 80 Frost build-up for 45 seconds. It is an effect that is unique to this weapon. The Dragon Halberd also has a great attack rating with 55 Strength, 45 Dexterity, and bolsters Physical Damage. Apart from that since this build doesn't come with a shield, unlike our other builds, the Dragon Halberd has a decent guard boost if fully upgraded for blocking enemy attacks. It is also versatile with its attacks where you can use R1 for a thrusting attack apart from its wide swings, allowing players to take advantage of the effects of the Spear Talisman.

When it comes to armor, we've specifically selected the Gelmir Knight Helm, Gelmir Knight Armor, Cuckoo Knight Gauntlets, and Gelmir Knight Greaves simply because they aesthetically fit well. But if you were to ask me "What armor should I use?", you can use whatever Armor you want as long as you have more than 51 Poise, because the idea of this build is that whenever you use Spinning Slash, you're going to Poise through the damage of bosses, that way, you can maximize using the skill. You can check our Armor page to find a complete list of armor in Elden Ring. As for Talismans, you can use Warrior Jar Shard or Shard of Alexander depending if you are at the beginning or later portion of the game, either one works, but essentially, the talisman boosts the attack power of Spinning Slash. Ritual Sword Talisman will further boost the damage by 10% more whenever you are in full health. Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman is a good option to reduce Physical Damage by 20% just for added survivability, and finally, since you will be using the thrust move frequently, the Spear Talisman will benefit this build since it will increase the thrusting weapon counterattack damage by 15%.

Ideally, the Stats for this Build are as follows: 50 Vigor, 30 Mind, 25 Endurance, 55 Strength, 45 Dexterity, and simply just ignore Intelligence, Faith, and Arcane. However, you can add about 15 points Faith if you want to use Flame Grant Me Strength which raises Physical and Fire-Affinity attack power. It is just an alternative here, but for this build, you won't need Faith. Using Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear, Spiked Cracked Tear can help with temporarily boosting strength or dexterity. You can also go for the Greenburst Crystal Tear to boost your stamina recovery or if you're someone who wants to keep spamming Spinning Slash, the Leaden Hardtear is great for boosting your poise. Finally, we highly recommend using Radahn's Great Rune just to gain that boost in HP, FP, and Stamina.

 

 
ELDEN RING GOLD BREAKER BUILD (NG+)
The Gold Breaker Build is an "NG+" build that utilizes Marika's Hammer, a weapon you acquire by trading the Elden Remembrance with Enia at Roundtable Hold after defeating the final boss in Elden Ring. Even though we were hesitant to create a build that focuses on the weapon, we've realized that there is much more the hammer weapon can offer and we have come up with a build that players can resort to if they want to use Marika's Hammer.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Marika's Hammer
Shield: Golden Greatshield
Armor: Leyndell Knight Set
Talismans: Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, Carian Filigreed Crest, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard, Curved Sword Talisman or Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength, Vigor, Endurance
Secondary Stats: Faith, Dexterity, Mind
Skills: Gold Breaker, Golden Vow
Spells: Flame Grant me Strength
Crystal Tear: Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear, Strength-Knot Crystal Tear, Dexterity-Knot Crystal Tear
Great Runes: Godrick's Great Rune or Radahn's Great Rune
Marika's Hammer is the primary equipment used for this build, although the weapon has holy damage (considered the worst damage type in general), it deals both Physical and Holy damage but most of it comes from Physical damage. It also has great scaling in terms of potential multiple playthroughs because the weapon scales with Strength, Dexterity, and Faith which are stats you would eventually improve to get more value out of the weapon. Another thing that makes the weapon special is its skill, Gold Breaker, triggering the character to leap up high and slam the ground causing a large AoE explosion that can hit multiple targets, a perfect skill for farming or if you are cornered by a group of enemies. And even if you don't use it as a way to one-shot a group, the skill is still viable to deal high damage and make a strong enemy such as a boss flinch or even send them flying up for a brief moment, allowing you to reassess your next move or use another Gold Breaker. Finally, Gold Breaker has infinite hyper armor when you are airborne, which means you cannot be interrupted if you are hit once you use the skill, using this skill is also a good way to attack a target from a distance while also closing in the gap.

The build also uses the Golden Order Seal but you can use any type of Sacred Seal that you prefer, the reason why we decided to use the Golden Order Seal is (1) it has 0.0 weight and (2) to buff the character with Flame Grant me Strength and Golden Vow. For defense, we are using the Golden Greatshield to easily block-counter enemy attacks. Since the character will have high strength, it's best to use this type of shield to utilize its great defense. Once a block counter connects, you can follow up with critical hits, and if you pair it with talismans such as the Assassin's Cerulean Dagger, your critical attacks can restore 15 FP, allowing you to use Gold Breaker more since the skill is FP-hungry. Now since the skill consumes high FP, having the Carian Filigreed Crest will lower the FP cost of the Gold Breaker skill by 25%. To boost the attack power of the skill, it's a must to either have Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard. Finally, for the last talisman, you can go for the Curved Sword Talisman or Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, the Curved Sword Talisman is great for increasing the guard counter damage since you'll be using block counters often for this build, however, you can opt for the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman if you are fighting a boss to reduce the Physical Damage taken by 20%.

Moving on to Stats, this build is running at 50 Vigor, 25 Mind, 31 Endurance, 53 Strength, 23 Dexterity, 25 Faith, and you won't need Intelligence and Arcane. 50 Vigor is standard in our opinion when you're coming from NG+ but we recommend improving it at some point to 60 Vigor since you will be trading damage whenever you use the Gold Breaker skill, so you want to make sure you can withstand the attacks you take. Mind is at 25 but we recommend extending this to about 35 Mind since you will be consuming a lot of FP when using your skills, 31 Endurance is balanced and good enough for equipping the armor used for this build and for medium rolls, but it can change depending on what armor you eventually end up using. 53 Strength and 23 Dexterity are what we've found to be the perfect points to distribute to have better damage. Finally 25 Faith, it will come naturally to put points to Faith since Marika's Hammer requires 19 FAI and to increase the damage.

 
ELDEN RING WARRIOR OF WAVES (ALL GAME BUILD)
The Warrior of Waves (Strength build) is an all-game build that can be used from the middle part of the game, until you beat Elden Ring, and through New Game Plus. This build primarily focuses on the use of the Ruins Greatsword weapon, a colossal sword that has fantastic scaling and devastating power once it is fully upgraded.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Ruins Greatsword
Shield: n/a
Armor: Greathelm, Beast Champion Armor, Beast Champion Gauntlets, Beast Champion Greaves
Talismans: Taker's Cameo, Carian Filigreed Crest, Great-Jar's Arsenal, Shard of Alexander, Ritual Sword Talisman, Ancestral Spirit's Horn
Primary Stats: Strength, Vigor, Endurance
Secondary Stats: Mind, Intelligence, Dexterity
Skills: Wave of Destruction
Spells: Flame Grant me Strength
Crystal Tear: Strength-Knot Crystal Tear, Spiked Cracked Tear, 
Great Runes: Godrick's Great Rune or Radahn's Great Rune
The Ruins Greatsword weapon is a colossal weapon that requires 50 STR and 16 INT. Most of the damage output of this weapon is physical and has some magic to it. The Ruins Greatsword can be acquired by defeating Misbegotten Warrior + Crucible Knight at Redmane Castle Plaza. [Elden Ring Map here] This boss fight is only accessible before the festival OR after defeating Starscourge Radahn and exhausting Witch-Hunter Jerren's subsequent dialogue (Video Location). To maximize the physical damage of this weapon, consuming items such as the Exalted Flesh increases the Physical Damage by 20% (15% in PvP0 for 30 seconds or even conjuring Flame Grant me Strength to raise the physical attack power of this weapon. To make it work especially if you are using this build in NG+, we highly recommend adding points to Faith to use spells such as Flame Grant me Strength or skills such as Golden Vow. Another thing that we love about this weapon has a great Guard Boost that allows the player to effectively block-counter enemy attacks as long as you have decent Poise, with that being said, pairing this build with the Taker's Cameo talisman is it allows the player to regain health while performing a block-counter.

The default skill for this weapon is the Wave of Destruction, a devastating weapon skill that shows the character raising the weapon and slamming it on the ground to release a vertical wave of gravity magic. The weapon skill damage scares primarily with weapon level. There are minor increases in damage from Strength levels and the least increase from Intelligence levels. It may not be the best weapon skill out there but it gets the job done by applying decent damage and sometimes interrupt the target or knocks them up into the air. Apart from that, it has great mid to long-range range allowing the player to cast the skill from a safe distance before following up with an attack, making it such a breeze to clear out enemies around unconventional areas when you are exploring.

And since the skill consumes high FP, we highly recommend pairing the build with the Carian Filigreed Crest to reduce the FP Cost by 25%. When creating this build, we found that it's not necessary to keep spamming the weapon skill, not only is it great for block-counters, but the weapon itself has a good-charged R2 attack where your attacks briefly conjure a small AoE gravity magic that still has an assurance that your attacks will connect.

When it comes to armor, this build uses the following armor pieces: Greathelm, Beast Champion Armor, Beast Champion Gauntlets, and Beast Champion Greaves. These pieces has high protection and poise, allowing you to take less damage when using block-counters, using the Wave of Destruction, or trading out incoming damage in favor of your attacks. It is highly recommended to pair this armor build with the Great-Jar's Arsenal talisman to raise the max equip load by 19%. However, if you aren't able to grab the following armor pieces, especially if you are using the Ruins Greatsword, simply acquire armor pieces that have decent protection and poise to balance out the heavy gameplay style of wielding the colossal weapon.

Moving over to the Stats, this build is running at 50 Vigor, 30 Mind, 35 Endurance, 80 Strength, 12 Dexterity, 16 Intelligence, 07 Faith, and 09 Arcane. Vigor is very important to increase your health pool and higher survivability when trading attacks. Mind is also important to alleviate the expensive cost when using the Wave of Destruction skill. Endurance is at 35 or at least high for this build to use a heavy armor set and the colossal weapon. And 80 Strength to further maximize the damage output of this weapon and the fact that this weapon has phenomenal S scaling with strength

 

 
ELDEN RING TOWER KNIGHT (ALL GAME BUILD)
The Tower Knight (Strength build) is an all-game build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a hammer build that can consistently break the stance of any and every enemy then you might want to check this build-out. This build utilizes the Morning Star hammer weapon and the Cragblade ash of war to easily break the stance or "stance break" against enemies.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Morning Star
Shield: Manor Towershield
Armor: Knight Set
Talismans: Green Turtle Talisman, Axe Talisman, Curved Sword Talisman, Greatshield Talisman
Primary Stats: Strength, Vigor, Endurance
Secondary Stats: Mind, Intelligence, Dexterity
Skills: Cragblade
Spells: Flame Grant Me Strength
Crystal Tear: Greenburst Crystal Tear, Spiked Cracked Tear, Stonebarb Cracked Tear
Great Runes: Radahn's Great Rune
For this build, we've chosen the Morning Star weapon. A hammer weapon fits well for this build since charged heavy attacks from a hammer deal 36 stance damage, and block counters also deal 36 stance damage. This is important since most bosses in Elden Ring have about 80 Stance while others have 100+ (120 for example for Godrick the Grafted). And if you deal the said amount of stance damage in a short period, they'll become vulnerable to critical attacks, hitting them a couple of times, or even a combination of both. Combining the Cragblade ash of war for this build will help you achieve the goal of easily breaking a target's stance since this skill applies a buff that increases physical attack power by 15%, stance damage by 10%, and stamina damage against a blocking enemy by 50%.

The ideal strategy when using the weapon and the skill is to activate the buff with Cragblade before you engage a boss battle, use charged heavy attacks as quickly as you can, and use a block counter to break their stance, following up with critical attacks or a string of attacks to punish the target while it is unable to move. Generally, you can use other hammers but the Morning Star is the best weapon to use for this build since it has bleed build-up that applies blood loss which is a good negative status effect to apply on some bosses. This weapon can be found in a chest inside a broken Carriage at the Weeping Peninsula just a bit south of the bridge from Limgrave. [Elden Ring Map here] Video of the location of the item. This build also utilizes the Manor Towershield, it has 67 Guard Boost, which is a good shield that you can pick up early in the game and seemingly is effective when using block-counters.

The Tower Knight build uses the Knight Set which can be purchased from the Twin Maiden Husks at the Roundtable Hold. When it comes to Talismans, this build uses the Green Turtle Talisman for Stamina recovery allowing you to block and attack frequently without worrying too much about managing your stamina, the Axe Talisman which increases the damage of charged attacks since you'll be frequently using charged attacks to get that stance break, the Curved Sword Talisman to increase your block counter damage, and finally, the Greatshield Talisman to reduce stamina damage taken while blocking. Depending on what you need, you can swap out the Greatshield Talisman for others such as the Ritual Sword Talisman if you want a boost to your attack power when your health is at maximum.

Moving over to the Stats, the build runs at 50 Vigor, 25 Mind, 30 Endurance, 80 Strength, 12 Dexterity, and you won't need any Intelligence, Faith, or Arcane for this build. The idea of the Tower Knight build is to have enough health to trade attacks, be aggressive in boss encounters, and increase survivability since the nature of this build will have you taking damage when in combat. Mind can be at least 25 or even lower, you just need enough to use Cragblade, maybe 2 times at max when using the skill, depending on the boss you're fighting. Endurance is up at 30 to gain high stamina to do multiple actions such as blocking, block-counters, use heavy attacks, and to be proficient in wearing the Knight Set. Strength is up at 80 to further increase the damage of your attacks.

 
ELDEN RING FLAME GUARDIAN (ALL GAME BUILD)
In this Elden Ring Build Guide, we'll be showcasing a Curved Great Club build. This is an All Game Faith build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a hammer build that can consistently break the stance of any and every enemy then you might want to check this build-out.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Curved Great Club, Erdtree Seal or Finger Seal
Shield: n/a
Armor: Bloodsoaked Mask, Bloodsoaked Manchettes, Blackflame Monk Armor, Blackflame Monk Greaves
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Bull-Goat's Talisman, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard
Primary Stats: Faith, Vigor, Mind
Secondary Stats: Endurance, Strength
Skills: Flaming Strike
Spells: Flame of the Fell God, Giantsflame Take Thee, Black Flame, Frenzied Burst, Golden Vow (Spell), Flame, Grant me Strength
Crystal Tear: Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear, Faith-Knot Crystal Tear
Great Runes: Godrick's Great Rune or Radahn's Great Rune
The Flame Guardian build for Elden Ring features the Curved Great Club weapon or as one of our community members has pointed it to be "Bonk, but in cursive". Aside from it being a perfect aesthetic fit for this build, the Curved Great Club has the highest damage when it is set to the Flame-art infusion, and it has great reach since it is extremely long for a great club weapon, making it quite useful in a lot of situations. The weapon of this build is equipped with the Flaming Strike ash of war/skill, allowing the player to release flames in a wide frontward arc and it also adds a cool effect that coats the weapon in fire. It's a skill that fits well for this build since it deals significant damage if the initial and follow-up attacks connect. The build also features the Erdtree Seal to cast spells but alternatively, you can go for Finger Seal if you don't have the Erdtree Seal yet.

Since the theme of this build is fire or flames, hence the name of the build being "Flame Guardian", there are specific items that are a must-have for this build such as the Fire Scorpion Charm and Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear making any fire-based skills or spells powerful. Specifically for this build, the primary flame spell we use is the Flame of the Fell God because it summons this large orb of fire that detonates after some time. If timed correctly, executing a combo such as conjuring the spell, and then aggressively attacking the target with the Flaming Strike skill with normal attacks will apply significant damage after the orb detonates. Alternatively, other flame-type spells can also work here such as Giantsflame Take Thee, Black Flame, Frenzied Burst, Golden Vow (Spell), or Flame, Grant me Strength.

As for armor, you can opt for more defense, depending on your preference. But for this build, we've chosen the following armor pieces for the aesthetic which are: Bloodsoaked Mask, Bloodsoaked Manchettes, Blackflame Monk Armor, and Blackflame Monk Greaves. To increase the survivability and to ensure that we can trade attacks, we recommend certain talismans such as the Bull-Goat's Talisman to raise Poise, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman to reduce the Physical Damage, and the Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard to boost the attack power of Skills.

When it comes to the attributes of this build, at Level 157, the stats are spread out as follows: 50 Vigor, 35 Mind, 25 Endurance, 24 Strength, 12 Dexterity, 16 Intelligence, 65 Faith, and 9 Arcane. Intelligence and Arcane are not required for this build, however, depending on your preference or if you want to equip certain spells that favor other stats, you will need to add points to the respective attribute required. Early on, you will have to prioritize Strength to wield the weapon, but as you progress, the primary stats you'll want to focus on are Faith, Vigor, and Mind.

Moving forward, this build uses the following crystal tears Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear and the Faith-Knot Crystal Tear which improves the effect of fire attacks and boosts the Faith attribute. And as for runes, we highly recommend Godrick's Great Rune to raise all of your attributes since this build utilizes almost all of the attributes for it to be effective. Alternatively, you can also go for Radahn's Great Rune for that extra HP, FP, and Stamina.

 

 
ELDEN RING RED ROGUE (ALL GAME BUILD)
In this Elden Ring Build Guide, we'll be showcasing a Reduvia dagger build. This is an All Game Arcane build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a dagger build that can consistently hemorrhage any enemy that isn't immune to blood lose then you might want to check this build-out.

Class: Bandit
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Reduvia
Shield: n/a
Armor: Skeletal Mask, Nox Swordstress Armor, Scaled Gauntlets, Nox Greaves
Talismans: Millicent's Prosthesis, Bull-Goat's Talisman, Lord of Blood's Exultation, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard
Alternate Talismans: Dagger Talisman, Green Turtle Talisman
Primary Stats: Arcane, Vigor, Endurance
Secondary Stats: Dexterity, Mind
Skills: Reduvia Blood Blade
Spells: n/a
Crystal Tear: Greenspill Crystal Tear, Dexterity-Knot Crystal Tear, or Thorny Cracked Tear
Great Runes: Radahn's Great Rune
The Red Rogue build for Elden Ring features the Reduvia dagger weapon, we highly recommend that if you are starting your journey for the first time or a New Game Plus, choose the Bandit class at it can utilize this weapon from the get-go upon obtaining the weapon, the class will also have met all the stat requirements of the Reduvia Dagger. This is a simple and straightforward build that we feel will work in the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion because of how much Bleed build-up it can apply to the enemies. To boost the damage of this weapon and other factors such as a faster build-up of the Bleed status effect and the effectiveness of the weapon's skill, we have added tons of points to Arcane, which is a must for this build to work.

What makes this weapon unique for this build is its skill, which is the Reduvia Blood Blade. It deals physical damage to enemies in a medium to short range distance, and it significantly is effective to apply and build Hemorrhage or Bleed with each hit and since Patch 1.07, its attack power has been increased and its damage detection to the weapon part has been added, making this such a deadly weapon. Regardless of the weapon only having medium to short range, it still has the capability and option for players to approach combat in various ways to poke enemies at a safe distance, you can build Hemorrhage, and to attack at close-range when necessary. On the other hand, for enemies that are immune to build, the Red Rogue build is still effective since the build comes with alternative equipment and also has decent amount of damage.

As for Armor, the armor pieces we've chosen for this build is more of fashion to fit the theme. Ideally, you want to have something that provides you with at least 51 Poise so that you can trade hits. You can equip whatever Armor you want if you try out this build. On the other hand, the armor pieces that are used for this build, obviously does not meet the 51 Poise requirement we mentioned, but for it to reach that number, we have the Bull-Goat's Talisman equipped to raise Poise by 33%.

Other talismans equipped are Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard to boost the attack power of the weapon's skill, Millicent's Prosthesis for extra Dex, and Lord of Blood's Exultation to raise the attack power for 20 seconds when Hemorrhage triggers which for this build, is the highlight, and will happen all the time. Other alternatives that you can use, depending on your preference, Dagger Talisman to increase the Critical Damage, Green Turtle Talisman to improve the recovery speed of your Stamina

When it comes to the attributes of this build,  the stats are spread out as follows: 50 Vigor, 22 Mind, 30 Endurance, 08 Strength, 25 Dexterity, 16 Intelligence, 07 Faith, and 80 Arcane. Intelligence and Faith are not required for this build, however, depending on your preference or if you want to equip certain spells that favor other stats, you will need to add points to the respective attribute required. Early on, you will have to prioritize Arcane to take advantage of this build.

And to finalize this build, the Red Rogue build for Elden Ring uses the Greenspill Crystal Tear to temporarily boost your stamina recovery since you will be spamming your attacks of the weapon, Dexterity-Knot Crystal Tear to temporarily boost Dexterity, alternatively, Thorny Cracked Tear can also work for this build since it will make your attacks stronger when you are consecutively spamming attacks. As for the rune, Radahn's Great Rune is the best way to go so that you gain more HP, FP, and Stamina.

 
ELDEN RING SPELLTHIEF (NEW GAME + BUILD)
In this Elden Ring Build Guide, we'll be showcasing a Glintstone Kris dagger build. This is a new game+ build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a dagger build that can range enemies down from afar and also deal great critical damage then you might want to check this build-out.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Glintstone Kris
Shield: Carian Knight's Shield
Armor: Spellblade's Pointed Hat, Black Knife Armor, Spellblade's Gloves, Spellblade's Trousers
Talismans: Magic Scorpion Charm, Ritual Sword Talisman, Godfrey Icon, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard
Primary Stats: Dexterity, Intelligence, Vigor
Secondary Stats: Endurance, Mind
Skills: Glintstone Dart, Carian Retaliation
Spells: n/a
Crystal Tear: Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear, Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear or Dexterity-knot Crystal Tear
Great Runes: Godrick's Great Rune or Radahn's Great Rune
The Spellthief build features the Glintstone Kris dagger, although the weapon itself doesn't feature anything major, however, it has a 110 Critical Rating which is average for a dagger weapon, it has decent damage, it's a light weapon, and comes with a unique weapon skill, the Glintstone Dart that works similarly to a sorcery spell, Glintstone Pebble. The difference with Glintstone Dart is after casting the dart, you can follow up with a thrusting attack which is completely optional. What's great about this is you can poke enemies from afar, potentially spamming the dart, but in some cases, if an enemy tries to close in, you can immediately use the thrusting attack for that advantage. Another difference between the Glintstone Dart and the Glintstone Pebble is the weapon skill, Glintstone Dart, costs more FP but deals more damage. Glintstone Dart can also pierce through enemies, allowing the skill to hit other enemies behind the original target. Glintstone Dart can also be charged by holding the button to deal extra damage.

The build comes with a shield and we are using the Carian Knight's Shield, not only does it fit the theme but it's something we recommend since the build has high Intelligence. It is entirely optional, but you can have the shield with no skill so that it is easier to manage the Glintstone Kris, and block attacks when needed, however, we highly recommend having the Carian Retaliation skill to parry attacks. And what Carian Retaliation offers is it makes parrying easy because of its great iframes, if done correctly, you can parry an enemy, and follow up with a critical attack.

For armor, this build uses the following armor pieces: Spellblade's Pointed Hat, Black Knife Armor, Spellblade's Gloves, and Spellblade's Trousers. For most of it, these pieces were chosen to fit the theme of the build, however, there is one armor piece we specifically want to highlight, which is the Black Knife Armor chest piece, since what this does when it is equipped is, it muffles the movements of the player, making it easier to backstab enemies and even confusing enemies when you attack them from long-range using the Glintstone Dart. The other pieces are from the Spellblade Set to acquire more value by increasing the damage of Glintstone Dart.

Onto Talismans, the items we've chosen for this build are talismans that can help with increasing the damage while also complimenting the Glintstone Kris. Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard is a no-brainer to have since it boosts the skill of the weapon, Magic Scorpion Charm which raises the magic damage, Ritual Sword Talisman to get that attack boost while HP is full, and Godfrey Icon to increase the damage of spells/skills when charging it.

When it comes to the attributes of this build, the stats are spread out as follows: 50 Vigor, 30 Mind, 25 Endurance, 10 Strength, 50 Dexterity, 50 Intelligence, 07 Faith, and 09 Arcane. Faith and Arcane are not required for this build and highly focuses on Intelligence and Dexterity. On the other hand, we highly recommend increasing Vigor to 60 and lowering Mind around 25, just so that you can survive challenging battles given the fact that we don't have that much protection from the armor that is used for this build.

As for the Crystal Tears used on this build, we have the Magic-Shrouding Cracked Tear, which is a must-have, to boost the damage of Glintstone Dart, then other Crystal Tears will depend on your preference such as the Intelligence-knot Crystal Tear, which is also a good choice to boost the overall damage of attacks, or Dexterity-knot Crystal Tear to boost Dexterity that helps boost melee attacks. Moving on to Great Runes, you can choose from Godrick's Great Rune or Radahn's Great Rune. Depending on what you need, Godrick's Great Rune is best picked if you want to raise all attributes, on the other hand, of you want to maximize your HP, FP, and Stamina, Radahn's is the one to go for.

 

 
ELDEN RING BLAZING BLACKBLADE (ALL GAME BUILD)
In this Elden Ring Build Guide, we'll be showcasing the Hookclaws weapon for the Blazking Blackblade build. This is an All-Game build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a claws build that shreds enemies so fast that you'd be surprised, then you might want to check this build-out.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Weapon: Hookclaws
Shield: n/a
Armor: Knight Set (Early Playthrough), Maliketh's Set (Main Armor set for this build)
Talismans: Fire Scorpion Charm, Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard
Primary Stats: Faith, Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind, Endurance
Skills: Flaming Strike
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame Grant Me Strength
Crystal Tear: Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear, Thorny Cracked Tear or Greenspill Crystal Tear
Great Runes: Radahn's Great Rune
The Blazing Blackblade build highlights the Hookclaws weapon, it is a good weapon out of all of the claws because you can acquire this weapon easily when you explore Stormveil Castle and it has great length or reach compared to other claws which can be quite an issue when facing enemies or bosses that have unusual design and movement. The Hookclaws in this build come with the Ash of War: Flaming Strike skill and are infused with Flame art. Upgrading the weapon to the Flame art infusion helps in achieving the minimum requirements of the weapon of 8 STR and 14 DEX, allowing the build to focus on upgrading the primary stat of this build, Faith, making it possible to equip any incantation you want to use, or in this case, specifically the spells Golden Vow and Flame Grant Me Strength that contributes to increasing the damage of the weapon.

For Armor, when you start, we highly recommend using the Knight Set and switching to Maliketh's Set upon acquiring it late in the game. The reason why the Knight Set and Maliket's Set are what we've mentioned is to acquire that 51 Poise, and you want to have that high poise to determine how you can resist collapsing under enemy attacks since for the most part, this build requires you to trade attacks when in combat. For talismans, first on the list is the Fire Scorpion Charm, which helps increase the weapon's fire damage. The second would be the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman to amplify our defenses. The third talisman is either Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard to boost the attack power of the Flaming Strike skill, and the fourth talisman goes to the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia to even maximize the damage with successive attacks since you will be spamming those slashes when using the Hookclaws.

When it comes to the attributes of this build, the stats are spread out as follows: 50 Vigor, 35 Mind, 25 Endurance, 08 Strength, 14 Dexterity, 16 Intelligence, 80 Faith, and 10 Arcane. Strength and Arcane are not required for this build and highly focuses on Faith and Vigor. Endurance is also a stat we'd like you to keep an eye on for this build as it is stamina-hungry when attacking.

As for the Crystal Tears used on this build, we have the Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear that compliments the weapon by boosting the power of fire attacks, and depending on what you prefer, Thorny Cracked Tear will work to further increase the damage when you attack repetitively or Greenspill Crystal Tear to temporarily boost stamina and its recovery speed. And finally, Radahn's Great Rune is the great rune that is perfect for this build since you'll get more HP, FP, and Stamina from it.

 
ELDEN RING BLACK GUARD (ALL GAME BUILD)
In this Elden Ring Build Guide, the highlight is a fist weapon, the Clinging Bone. This is an All-Game build that takes place after level 150. If you’ve been looking for a fists build that attacks fast and can drain the enemies' HP then you might want to check this build-out.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Equal Charges
Main Weapon: Clinging Bone
Alternate Weapon: Marais Executioner's Sword or Regalia of Eochaid
Shield: Scorpion Kite Shield or Jellyfish Shield
Armor: Greathelm, Royal Remains Armor, Lionel's Gauntlets, Royal Remains Greaves
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Millicent's Prosthesis, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia or Winged Sword Insignia, Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard
Alternate Talismans: Axe Talisman, Magic Scorpion Charm, Dagger Talisman, Godfrey Icon
Primary Stats: Dexterity, Arcane, Vigor
Secondary Stats: Mind, Endurance
Skills: Lifesteal Fist, Eochaid's Dancing Blade
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame Grant Me Strength
Crystal Tear: Greenburst Crystal Tear, Thorny Cracked Tear or Spiked Cracked Tear
Great Runes: Godrick's Great Rune or Radahn's Great Rune
The Back Guard build highlights the Clinging Bone weapon, it has physical and magic damage and is equipped with a unique skill, Lifesteal Fist. The skill shows that it grabs onto a "humanoid" type of enemy, it goes through enemies that are even blocking, damaging, and heals about 30% of your max health. The skill predominantly does insane magic damage making it possible to pair with other items such as the Magic Scorpion Charm to further boost its damage. What's also great about this is the flexibility of how you can approach combat, such as using block-counters, dual-wield, you can steal health from your enemies, and you can even swap between the alternate weapons that come with this such as Marais Executioner's Sword or Regalia of Eochaid. As for shields, this build primarily uses the Scorpion Kite Shield because of its low strength requirement, but if you want to have better defenses, you can opt for the Jellyfish Shield in exchange for points into the strength requirement.

For Armor, this build uses a mixture of the following pieces which are: Greathlem, Royal Remains Armor, Lionel's Gauntlets, Royal Remains Greaves. By having these pieces on, the build can reach the desired number of Poise so that you can trade hits and use other talismans that can benefit the weapons of this build. For talismans, Ritual Sword Talisman is good to raise the attack power when you're at max HP, and considering that you have a lifesteal skill, you'll most likely be at max HP for most of the time, so why not have that boost of damage whenever you're healthy.

Millicent's Prosthesis is great for raising the attack power with successive attacks and boosts Dexterity. Rotten Winged Sword Insignia or Winged Sword Insignia to boost the attack power with successive attacks. Shard of Alexander or Warrior Jar Shard to boos the attack power of skills. Alternative Talismans you can use for this build are the Axe Talisman to increase the damage of charged attacks, Magic Scorpion Charm for more Magic Damage, Dagger Talisman to increase the Critical Damage, or even Godfrey Icon to raise the attack power of charged spells and skills. When it comes to the attributes of this build, the stats are spread out as follows: 50 Vigor, 20 Mind, 30 Endurance, 12 Strength, 55 Dexterity, 16 Intelligence, 07 Faith, and 50 Arcane.

As for the Crystal Tears used on this build, depending on what you need and the situation you are about to face in combat, Thorny Cracked Tear is good for increasing damage when you continuously attack, Greenburst Crystal Tear is great for better stamina recovery, or the Spiked Cracked Tear just to further boost the damage of charged attacks. And finally, for Great Runes, you can go for Godrick's Great Rune to raise all your attributes since this build requires about 6 out of the 8 stats for it to work, or Radahn's Great Rune to acquire that boost in HP, FP, and Stamina.

ELDEN RING BUILDS BY THE COMMUNITY
ELDEN RING STATUS BLADEMASTER (LEVEL 100)
A master of incantations and arcane weaponry that combines both to apply several status effects to boost his overall damage and decimate any foe.

Class: Confessor
Flask Spread: Split between FP & HP
Weapon: Antspur rapier, Uchigatana, Black Knife and Dragon communion seal
Alternate weapons: Feel free to use any kind of weapon as long as it can apply bleed, poison or scarlet rot.
Armor: White mask combined with anything that allows mid or fast rolls 
Spirit ash: Mimic Tear or Black knife tiche
Primary Stats: Faith & Arcane 
Secondary Stats: Dexterity
Skills: Bloodhound's step or anything that helps to apply Bleed or poison faster
Incantations: Black flame ritual, Poison mist, Rotten Breath, Swarm of flies, Scarlet Aeonia and Black flame
Talismans: Kindred of rot's exultation, Lord of blood's exultation, Marika's soreseal
The way this build work is to apply different status effects to your enemies, and in doing so you're not only taking their HP away faster but, thanks to Kindred of rot's exultation and Lord of blood's exultation talismans, you are boosting your own damage as well. You can achieve these by giving bleed or poison to your weapons through ashes of war, and using weapons with scarlet rot on them like the Antspur Rapier or the Scorpion's stinger. The build itself is pretty flexible because you have several options in the game to help you out with status effects. The dragon communion seal is the best choice cause of his Arc/Faith scaling, the Black knife is a good choice in any build to start a fight cause of the debuff you can apply with it. The bloodhound's step is a great choice for fast combat, but any ash will do as long as you choose poison or bleed damage for your weapon.

If you use Mimic tear as your spirit ash, summon it with Dragon communion seal + Black Knife as this is the best option to help you out with applying different status effects with your incantations while also applying the weapon's debuff. Alternatively you can use the Black knife tiche who also uses this weapon and will apply the dagger's debuff.

I always recommend to try to apply the Scarlet rot debuff first, opening with 1 or 2 Rotten breath's or the use of Antspur rapier are your best choices, while Scarlet Aeonia is a good late game choice in some situations. You can also pair Antspur rapier with Rogier's rapier to have a great dual wielding status machine. Swarm of flies is a great bleed buildup incantation for more big and stationary targets, but can also work effectively if you lure more agile targets to a stationary position, same principle applies for the Poison mist incantation. The Uchigatana with bleed/poison is an amazing choice here (as any with base bleed damage that can be infused with ashes of war), for a late game alternative i recommend the Hand of Malenia which has an amazing skill, bleed damage and a little more of poise damage. Black flame and Black flame ritual are here as personal choice, as i think they are flexible and great incantations overall. Lastly i have to mention Flame, grant me strenghth and Golden vow which are good damage boosters as well.

As an alternative for status buildup you can choose to use coating incantations as well as consumables, with that in mind i recommend switching Scarlet Aeonia for Black flame blade, Bloodflame blade and Poison armament, and also to make room for Vyke's dragonbolt which is a great damage booster overall. But bare in mind that going this route will prevent you from applying ashes of war to provide bleed/poison and arcane scaling on your weapons.

ELDEN RING BUILD: ROBIN HOOD THE MAD (LEVEL 50 AND HIGHER) 
Bow and Spear archetype with madness spells/weapon. For lore background Robin Hood aquires a spear and he begins to succumb to temptation craving more and more maddening power.

Class: Bandit
Flask Spread: More FP the higher levels you get but anything you are comfortable with.
Weapon: Vyke's War Spear, Finger Seal or Erdtree Seal (ideally Frenzied Flame Seal but this item linked to a quest line so up to you) and any bow or light bow you want
Shield: None but you can use one if u want
Armor: Surprisingly I cannot find anything for lore/fashion style maybe Gaurdian Set (no helm) so feel free to experiment with armor try  and find gear with decent Focus value.
Primary Stats: Faith, Mind, 
Secondary Stats: Dex (at least 20) Strength (at least 16)
Skills: Barrage and Mighty Shot depending if you use Light Bow or Bow. No ashes of war for melee as Vyke's War Spear has unique skill.
Spells: Up to you try all 5 of the Frenzied Flame spells and go with what you enjoy!
Play this class any way you like it has alot of versatility with crafting different arrow effects. For solo play using bow only can be resource consuming so have a good balance for range and melee, when in CO-OP it is alot of fun using the bow only  but that just preference. I think madness is a interesting mechanic so wanted to build a class around it which had both melee and range, it is viable in PVP to I know the spear gets some hate but it is really fun to use and the skill looks awesome one last lore nod if u use spirit summons try and use ones that summon more than one person then u can have your Merry Men while you get your bow out and attack from the back.

Talisman tips, Increasing resistance to madness can help as you are just as likely to become as mad as your target also reducing FP is helpful but really find a combo you like and go with it.

 

ELDEN RING BUILD: FINGERPRINT ACOLYTE (LEVEL 50+)
Description: Themed after Vyke, using Frenzied Flame associated equipment and spells.

Class: Confessor
Flask Spread: Mostly HP with some FP, depends on playstyle
Weapon: Vyke's War Spear, Finger Seal / Godslayer Seal
Shield: In particularly late game, Fingerprint Stone Shield. Any other medium or greatshield works well early game, for a reasonably light and moderately useful one consider the Jellyfish Shield.
Armor: Anything you want to wear, but particularly late game the Fingerprint Set. Good early to mid game contenders are the Land of Reeds Set or the Raging Wolf Set.
Primary Stats: Dex, Faith
Secondary Stats: Strength, Mind, Endurance
Skills: Barricade Shield can be nice on the Fingerprint Stone Shield, but no other Ashes of War fit particularly well
Spells: The Frenzied Flame Incantations fit the theme of this build. The Flame of Frenzy staggers bosses, particularly large ones, exceptionally well. Frenzied Burst is a good long-range shield-piercing spell, and Howl of Shabriri is a moderately useful damage buff. The final two spells are quite late-game and situational, but useful. Inescapable Frenzy is good vs NPC invaders if you can land it. Unendurable Frenzy is outstanding combined with defensive buffs and high focus, but situational as well. Other useful incantations are Flame, Cleanse Me, to cure rot, and Flame, Grant Me Strength, which benefits Vyke's War Spear.
Early game, you can pretty easily collect the incantations and eventually make your way up to Vyke's invasion and claim his spear. The spear, paired with a damage buff plus stancebreaking on some bosses from the Flame of Frenzy incantation, is an effective weapon for the majority of the game. Pairing Vyke's War Spear with a shield for guard counter or parry purposes deals with normal enemies well. You can probably invest in faith and dexterity about evenly, if you tend to use more incantations than melee than favor faith but otherwise Vyke's War Spear scales slightly better with dexterity. Enough strength to use whatever shield if you're using one, and then enough endurance, mind, and vigor such that you don't have issues with lack of HP/FP/carrying capacity. Near the endgame, if you want the full Fingerprint Set plus shield you'll need a lot of endurance to not stay burdened.

ELDEN RING BUILD: VERGIL BUILD(LEVEL 150)
Description: This Build is Themed after Vergil from Devil May Cry.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Split evenly among FP and HP
Weapon: MOONVEIL, WAKIZASHI, Carian GlintBlade Staff
Shield: None
Armor: Light Armor or Med Armor
Primary Stats:  INTELLIGENCE, Mind
Secondary Stats: Vigor, Dexterity 
Skills: BLOODHOUND'S STEP, Transient Moonlight
Spells: Terra Magica, Magic GlintBlade , GlintBlade Phalax, Carian Phalax , GreatBlade Phalax , Carian Retaliation 
Talismans:  Radagon Icon , Graven-Mass Talisman ,  Magic Scorpion Charm, Shard Of Alexander 
Play This class any way you would like because its a mix between melee and ranged playstyles. But what i would recommend is using Terra magica at a start of a boss fight or a really difficult encounter because its buffs your dmg then using either one of the phalax spells mentioned above and spamming magic glintblade, However if the enemy comes close to you then use the skill of the moonveil katana Transient Moonlight which will help you do dmg from melee range. After some testing For optimal play You want the Moonveil in your main hand and the Carian GlintBlade Staff in your offhand also equip/slot the Wakazashi with Bloodhound's step because its good for dodging and creating some distance giving you some breathing room. If your above level 150 u would want to focus on dexterity because it  will shorten the casting time of Your spells.

 

Tips for FLASK OF WONDROUS PHYSICK: After Some testing You either want to go with Magic-Shrouding Cracked tear Which boosts the magic attacks or Optionally Stonebarb Cracked Tear Which will help you staggers enemies , Lastly i have to mention that running Cerulean Hidden tear is optimal for this build as it eliminates fp consumption and gives you more time to cast spells and Transient Moonlight.

Tl;dr: How to play in short
This build was designed mainly for PvP, Duels or multiplayer with friends.
For  PvE you can use Raptor's Black Feathers Chest and Claw Talisman instead of Bull-Goat's Talisman!

1) Always two-hand your colossal Greatsword (1.2x strength multiplier)!
2) Only use Flask of Wonderous Physick and Bioled Crab before a major fight, like an invasion or main boss!
3) Use Crouch + Light Attack to roll-catch enemies in a straight line!
4) Use fast light attacks if the enemy doesn't back of and tries to trade with you.
5) Use the Bloodhound's Step Skill of your Greatsword to dodge ash of war skills, ranged attacks or to close the distance!
6) Use Throwing Dagger to pop the bubble of "Uplifting Aromatic", remove red glowing Ritual Sword Talisman [PvP] or to aggro and lure enemies from further away [PvE].
7) optional Use "Heavy" Nightrider Glaive+25 with Glintstone Pebble to poke and burst through shields! Hotswap required.


Giving reasons for certain items (only PvP)
Turtle Shell, Turtle Talisman, Greenburst Tear: well you can read that in the title. Very high stermina recovery speed is very important for colossal weapons in general, if you intend to hit multiple blows in a rapid fashion.

Heavy Load → "fat rolling". Title aswell as requring a slightly diffrent playstyle which evolves around blocking with your Greatsword aswell as using/ abusing Bloodhound's Step. Unique heavy load build.

Bull-Goat's Talisman outpoises the poise damage of Great Spears (112), dual Spear, Katana, etc. (111) with your Poise of 128. So in general going above 122 poise is a huge breakpoint. (not exactly accurate bull-goat -25% poise damage -> still above some certain poise damage caps)

Feel free, to change, adopt this build in any form you want. Hf.
ELDEN RING GREATSWORD VAMPYRE BUILD (LEVEL 100)
A Strength/Faith hybrid build that dual wields Great Swords and uses life steal to stay alive

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Some HP, mostly FP
Weapon: Clawmark Seal, Blasphemous Blade & Sword of Milos
Armor: Raptor's Black Feathers & any that still allows you to med roll
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Radagon's Soreseal, Fire-Scorpion Charm & Taker's Cameo (while exploring)/Claw Talisman (for boss fights)
Primary Stats: Strength & Faith
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Mind
Spells: Golden Vow, Flame, Grant Me Strength, Stone of Gurranq, Blessing's Boon
Mix of Wonderous Physick: Flame-Shrouded Crack Tear, Greenburst Crystal Tear
Great Rune: Rykard's Great Rune (while exploring), Godrick's Great Rune (for boss fights)
The way this Build works is that you'll generate HP and FP for every kill thanks to the combiantion of Rykard's Rune, Taker's Cameo, and the passive effects of your Great Swords, power stancing them to do devastating damage with L1 jump attacks. Taker's Flames does great AOE damage and also heals you on hit.

You'll carry the Blasphemous Blade and Clawmark Seal in your right hand and Sword of Milos in your left, two-handing the Seal when you cast spells to gain extra damage from Strength Scaling and bonus damage to Stone of Gurranq, giving you a great ranged option, and the Sword of Milos will refund you some of the FP spent on kill.

You'll buff with Golden Vow and Blessing's Boon constantly to increase your damage output and keeping the Ritual Sword Talisman buff online whenever you are in combat, using Flame, Grant Me Strength for tougher enemies and boss fights.

Against fire immune enemies, swap the Sword of Milos to your right hand and swap the Fire Scorpion Charm for the Roar Talisman, which buffs Milo's Roar, applying a debuff on nearby enemies and making them stagger.

 

ELDEN RING BLOOD-RED FALLING STAR (LEVEL 150)
A pure Strength build that focuses on running over enemies with a great hammer, causing bloodloss and using lifesteal to stay alive

Class: Vagabond
Flask Spread: Some HP, mostly FP
Weapon: Heavy Great Stars & Sacrificial Axe, Clawmark Seal
Armor: White Mask & Bull-Goat Set
Talismans: Ritual Sword Talisman, Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, Lord of Blood's Exultation, Great-Jars's Arsenal
Primary Stats: Strength (80), Vigor (45) & Endurance (41)
Secondary Stats: Mind (14), Faith (17) & Arcane (10) to meet stat requirements
Spells: Flame, Grant Me Strength, Bloodflame Blade, Blackflame Blade, Stone of Gurranq, Bestial Vitality, Black Flame
Skills: Prelate's Charge, Golden Vow
Mix of Wonderous Physick: Thorny Cracked Tear, Flame-Shrouded Crack Tear
Great Rune: Rykard's Great Rune (while exploring), Mohg's Great Rune (for boss fights)
Spirit Summon: Mimic Tear Ashes

The way this Build works is that you'll barrel down on enemies with Prelate's Charge while two-handing the Great Stars, causing sucessive hits which heal you thanks to the Great Stars's passive effect and triggering the effects of the Rotten Winged Sword insignia and also causing Bloodloss, which triggers the effects of the Lord of Blood's Exultation and White Mask. 

You'll carry the Great Stars and Clawmark Seal in your right hand and Sacrificial Axe in your left, two-handing the Seal when you cast spells to gain extra damage from Strength Scaling and bonus damage to Stone of Gurranq and Black Flame, giving you a great ranged option, and the Sacrificial Axe will refund you some of the FP spent on kill.
The Sacrificial Axe in your offhand can be infused with Golden Vow as yet another way to buff this build's damage. Bloodflame Blade will obviously apply Bloodflame to the Great Stars, adding more bloodloss buildup and fire damage, which is increased by Flame, Grant Me Strength. Against bloodloss immune enemies use Blackflame Blade instead of Bloodflame Blade.

You'll buff with Golden Vow and Bestial Vitality constantly to increase your damage output and keeping the Ritual Sword Talisman buff online whenever you are in combat, using Flame, Grant Me Strength for tougher enemies and boss fights.

Mohg's Great Rune will infuse Spirit Summons with an effect akin to, and stacking with, the Lord of Blood Exultation, thus making the Mimic Tear the preffered choice for this build. It will also make it so that the summoner will regain HP for every kill the summon scores, making it a great choice for landscape exporation where summoning is permited.

The Ungest of Bungas, an absolute unit.  High enough level to achieve optimal Strength and Poise.  Low enough level to still easily participate in multiplayer.  Wins most fights easily by spamming Lion's Claw.  If you do run out of FP, charged R2 is still amazing.  Two Fingers Heirloom and Finger Seal for any buffs/spells with 15 Faith requirement or lower - can be switched with other weapon/talisman if/when there's no use for buffs/spells.  Bull-Goat's Talisman to push Poise to 133 - can be switched with other talismans to focus more on damage if you only need 100 Poise.  Pulley Crossbow +10 with Burred Bolts for punishing enemies who refuse to get under your hammer.

 

MAGIC FROST KNIGHT (150)
Intelligence/quality build that uses spells from range and levels enemies at melee range with frost attacks

Class: Prisoner
Flask Spread: 5HP/8FP
Weapon: Dark moon greatsword, Carian regal scepter
Shield: None
Armor: Crucible tree set or Night´s cavalry set
Talismans: Erdtree´s favour, Graven-mass talisman, Radagon icon and Dragoncrest shield or Dragoncrest greatshield talisman
Primary Stats: Intelligence/Vigor/Mind
Secondary Stats: Dexterity/Endurance
Stats:
Vigor: 40
Mind: 40
Endurance: 25
Strength: 20
Dexterity: 30
Intelligence: 60
Faith: 6
Arcane: 9
Skills: Moonlight greatsword
Spells: Adula´s moonblade, Comet, Comet azur, Loretta´s greatbow/mastery and Zamor ice storm
The build works by first using Loretta´s greatbow or Comet to deal damage from range depending on the distance, Comet azur melts away bigger enemies/bosses and when in melee range, buff the Darkmoon greatsword with Moonlight greatsword and start chopping and slicing. Adula´s moonblade is great at melee range as well. If multiple enemies come charging your way, use the Zamor ice storm. Equipping the Godrick´s great rune gives a good boost as well.

Moonveil can be used instead of Dark moon greatsword if you like to be faster at melee range than with a big clumsy greatsword.

Flask spread more on the FP side of things.

Various Offensive and other Supportive Spells
"Your Spells are your Weapons. Your Distance to your enemies is your Armors. Your FP is your Life. Your Experience is the key to your Survival." No other saying fits better to explain how this pure caster build works. In general this build fits for players who want to go solo in their higher journeys, or assisting other player in Co-op or even good for PvP. Their main roles are Offense and Support with high mobility for dodging many incoming attacks.

Starting this build with level 150 is a challenge. If your Dexterity is at 20 or lower, it's quite a risk if you choose to attack with stronger spells. By increasing your dexterity to 50 you can at least cast the spells fast enough and have better chance to dodge the incoming attacks while or after casting.

The spell choice varies for different players. Offensive spells like Night Comet, Meteorite of Astel, Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike, or Burn, O Flame can have a very high DPS, if used and boosted correctly. One healing spell must be equipped and convert ALL your flasks into Flask of Cerulean Tear ONLY, since healing spells like Lord's Heal or Erdtree Heal heals more HP in comparison to drinking one Flask of Crimson Tear +12. Just by drinking one Flask of Cerulean Tear +12 gives you 220 FP, which gives you the opprtunity to cast Erdtree Heal at least 3x in total.

Equipping the booster catalyst on your off-hand, which corresponds to the specified spell type, and by casting the corresponding spell with a catalyst with the best Sorcery or Incantation scaling is a must. In addition to that, equipping the right Talismans and casting buff spells like Golden Vow and Terra Magica and/or casting debuff spells on enemies with one of Full Moon Sorcery Spells or Greyoll's Roar plus using the Mix of Wondrous Physick with the right boosting Crystal Tears can make the damage output for that spell skyrocketing.

 

CAVEMAN BRAIN (150 OR HIGHER)
 for those who don't care for nor understand the more sophisticated parts of Elden ring

Class: wretch
Flask Spread: 14-0 only HP flask of wonderous physick- Strength-Knot Crystal Tear , Opaline BubbleTear
Weapon: 2x Heavy Greatsword +25
Shield: none
Armor: Jar helmet with highest poise set possible while meduim weight
Talismans: Bull-Goat's Talisman , Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman , Red-Feathered Branchsword , Rotten Winged Sword Insignia
Primary Stats: Vigor, endurance
Secondary Stats: strength
Skills: Barbaric roar , Lion's claw
Spells: none
      if your going to use this build there's no point in expecting you to read this, but just in case. this build is very very simple and easy to use but still very strong in PvP and PvE. just drink your wonderous physick when going in for a charge, and use barbaric roar when needed. remember that you are a not so glass, glass cannon that can kill someone in two hits so be dumb and be a caveman who only knows to attack the enemy.

DUELIST OF GURRANQ (LEVEL 150)
This build utilizes the Scarlet Rot buildup and heavy attacks of the Rotten Greataxe to deal huge amounts of damage at close range, and bestial incantations from Gurranq to improvise at range.

Class: Any
Flask Spread: Mostly HP, Some FP
Weapon: Rotten Greataxe
Catalyst: Clawmark Seal
Talismans: Milicent's Prosthesis, Shard of Alexander, Starscourge Heirloom, Radagon Icon
Armor: Duelist Helm, Kaiden Armor, Scaled Gauntlets & Greaves
Primary Stats: Vigor & Strength
Secondary Stats: Endurance & Faith
Skills: Hoarah Loux's Earthshaker
Spells: Beast Claw, Bestial Sling, Stone of Gurranq, Golden Vow & Flame, Grant Me Strength
The way this build works is that you will mostly buff yourself with Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength before charging into enemies and perform melee attacks at close range with the Rotten Greataxe and start building up Scarlet Rot. The other spells and skills in this build each have their own varied purpose. Bestial Sling should be used when you want to distance yourself from an ememy to heal, cast this incantation with the buffed casting speed of Radagon Icon to stun enemies, giving you some air. Beast Claw can be used at mid-ranged enemies, or can be combo-ed with either the striking attacks of the greataxe or right after distancing with Bestial Sling. Stone of Gurranq is specifically used for enemies that keep on trying to avoid you, and especially useful against enemies using jump attacks. And lastly, the chosen Ash of War, Hoarah Loux's Earthshaker can be used to deal with small, grouped enemies who swarm on you, or trading for some huge poise damage.

 

GIGACHAD (LEVEL 150-200 | JOURNEY 2)
This build is focused on doing the maximum damage possible with every bonk while not caring much about taking damage.

Class: Hero for min-max, any for fun
Flask Spread: All HP
Weapon: Occult Giant-Crusher x2
Shield: None
Armor: Bull-Goat Set
Talismans: Erdtree's Favor +2, Dragoncrest Greatshield, Viridian Amber Medallion +2, Great-Jar's Arsenal if you have less than 54 Endurance, any that doesn't overload you otherwise (Suggestions: Golden Scarab in PvE to level faster, Claw Talisman if you need more damage, Bull-Goat's Talisman for maximum poise)
Primary Stats: Strength & Arcane
Secondary Stats: Vigor & Endurance
Skills: Royal Knight's Resolve or any that can be Occult infused
Spells: None
FIRST STEPS
This build is about doing as much damage as possible with every swing. It is important to Occult infuse the crushers because that gives them the greatest physical AR potential in the game. At the end of journey 1 you should be two-handing an Occult Giant-Crusher, wearing the Bull-Goat Set, and using the three main talismans + Jarsenal. Your stats should be: 60 Vigor, 26 Endurance, 40 Strength, and whatever is left into Arcane. When you start journey 2 you should focus on getting the second crusher, 60 Strength, and 42 Endurance, which will allow you to dual-wield.

FINISHING TOUCHES
At this point you've completed the basic build and can choose how to proceed. My recommendation is to level your Endurance to 54 and replace the Great-Jar with the Claw Talisman. This buffs your jump attacks, so use them whenever you can. Any extra levels you get after this can be put towards getting Arcane and Strength up to 80.

HOW TO USE THE BUILD
The way to play this build is to just go up to enemies and bonk them to death with your crushers. You can easily survive getting hit a few times, so focus on dodging the attacks that will stagger you or knock you down. This build does fat roll, but it seems to be good enough. When low on HP make some space and chug a flask.`;
