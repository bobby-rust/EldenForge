# EldenForge

A web app dedicated to generating challenging Elden Ring scenarios and builds for players.

## TODO
- Add option to combine weapons, staves, and seals + only generate incants IF a seal was rolled + only generate sorcs IF a staff was rolled

## Future Roadmap

-   Build generation config (certain item types, scaling levels, required attributes, etc.)
-   Provide dashboard for getting all items by a filter(s). Ex. Show all weapons that scale with Int and Dex
-   Draggable categories for organizing build order
-   Generate challenge runs (?)
-   Create a build page with stats (?)
